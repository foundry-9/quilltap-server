/**
 * Background-job type → realtime topics
 *
 * A completed job is the moment a lot of server state stops being what the
 * open tabs think it is. The dispatcher knows the job's type and payload the
 * instant its write batch commits, which makes that one place a better
 * publisher than a dozen scattered handlers — and the handlers run in the
 * forked child, where publishing is a no-op anyway.
 *
 * This table is deliberately partial. A job type absent from it still moves
 * the `jobs` topic (the queue itself changed); it just has no *entity* worth
 * announcing, or its entity is covered by the write-batch mapping in
 * `job-dispatcher`'s `dispatchInvalidations`.
