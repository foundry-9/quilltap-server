# Turn Manager

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/salon)**

The Turn Manager controls who speaks next in multi-character chats. It ensures conversations flow naturally, with each character getting opportunities to contribute while preventing any single character from dominating.

## What Is the Turn Manager?

The Turn Manager is the system that:

- **Selects Speakers** — Determines which character speaks next
- **Tracks Rounds** — Knows who has spoken since your last message
- **Manages Fairness** — Ensures balanced participation using talkativeness weights
- **Handles Queues** — Processes manual queue requests first
- **Signals Your Turn** — Tells you when all characters have spoken

## How Turn Cycles Work

### The Basic Cycle

A complete turn cycle looks like this:

1. **You Send a Message**
   - Your message triggers the auto-response phase
   - All active characters become eligible to speak

2. **Characters Take Turns**
   - Each character speaks once per cycle
   - Turn Manager selects who goes next
   - Characters speak one at a time

3. **Cycle Completes**
   - When all active characters have spoken once
   - Turn indicator shows "Your turn"
   - You can send your next message

4. **Repeat**
   - Your next message starts a new cycle

### Example Cycle

With three characters (Alice, Bob, Carol):

1. You: "Hello everyone!"
2. Alice: "Hi there!" (selected first)
3. Carol: "Nice to meet you!" (selected second)
4. Bob: "Greetings!" (selected third)
5. **Your turn** — All have spoken, you can respond

## Speaker Selection

### Priority Order

The Turn Manager selects the next speaker in this order:

1. **Queued Characters First**
   - If you've manually queued someone, they speak next
   - Queue is first-in-first-out (FIFO)

2. **Weighted Random Selection**
   - Among eligible characters (those who haven't spoken this cycle)
   - Based on talkativeness weights
   - Higher talkativeness = higher chance of being selected

3. **Your Turn**
   - When no eligible characters remain
   - All have spoken since your last message

### Eligibility Rules

A character is eligible to speak if:

- They are **active** or **silent** (not absent or removed)
- They are **LLM-controlled** (not impersonated, unless queued)
- They have **not spoken** since your last message
- They are **not the previous speaker** (except in single-character situations)

**Note:** Silent characters are still selected for turns — the difference is that their prompt instructs them to observe without speaking aloud. They may describe inner thoughts and physical reactions but not audible dialogue.

### Talkativeness Weights

Each character has a talkativeness setting (0 to 1):

- **0.0** — Never volunteers to speak (can still be nudged/queued)
- **0.25** — Quiet, speaks occasionally
- **0.5** — Balanced participation (default)
- **0.75** — Talkative, speaks often
- **1.0** — Very talkative, speaks as often as possible

The selection formula considers all eligible characters' weights. A character with weight 0.8 is roughly four times more likely to be selected than one with weight 0.2.

## Manual Turn Control

### Nudge

**What it does:** Forces a character to speak immediately.

**How to use:**

1. Find the character in the Participants Sidebar
2. Click the **Nudge** button
3. They respond immediately, regardless of the normal queue

**When to use:**

- A character should react to something specific right now
- You want to hear from a particular character next
- Breaking the normal flow for dramatic effect

**Notes:**

- Nudged character speaks even if they already spoke this cycle
- Nudge takes priority over the queue
- Only works for LLM-controlled characters

### Queue

**What it does:** Adds characters to an ordered speaking list.

**How to use:**

1. Click **Queue** on a character's card
2. They're added to the back of the queue
3. Badge shows their queue position (1, 2, 3...)
4. Queued characters speak in order before random selection resumes

**When to use:**

- Planning a sequence of speakers
- Ensuring specific characters respond to something
- Setting up a deliberate conversation flow

**Managing the queue:**

- Queue is processed in order (first queued speaks first)
- After queue empties, normal weighted selection resumes
- Click **Dequeue** to remove someone from the queue
- Queue persists across your messages until cleared

### Dequeue

**What it does:** Removes a character from the pending queue.

**How to use:**

1. Find the queued character (they'll have a position badge)
2. Click **Dequeue** button
3. They're removed from the queue
4. Other characters' positions adjust accordingly

## Turn Indicators

### Turn Order Display

The participant sidebar shows a **predicted turn order** for all participants. Each participant has a numbered position badge indicating when they're expected to speak:

**Position Badges:**

1. **Generating (green, pulsing)** — Currently generating a response (#1 during generation)
2. **Next (green, static)** — Selected as the next speaker
3. **Queued (blue)** — Manually queued to speak
4. **Eligible (neutral)** — Available to speak this cycle, sorted by talkativeness
5. **Your Turn (amber)** — Indicates the user's position in the cycle
6. **Spoken (dimmed)** — Already spoke this cycle
7. **Silent (no badge, muted)** — Present but observing silently, still receives turns
8. **Absent (no badge, dimmed)** — Away from the scene, turns skipped entirely

Participants are automatically sorted in the sidebar by their predicted turn position, so you can see at a glance who's speaking, who's next, and who has already spoken.

### Interrupt/Stop Button

When a character is generating a response, their card shows a **Stop** button instead of the usual Nudge/Queue button. Click it to interrupt the current generation. In multi-character chats, the stop button appears on the generating character's card in the sidebar rather than in the chat composer.

### Visual Feedback

The UI shows turn status in several ways:

**Current Speaker:**
- Glowing/animated avatar border
- Green pulsing position badge (#1)
- Stop button on their card
- Active highlight on their card

**Your Turn:**
- Header shows "Your turn to speak"
- Amber position badge on your persona card
- Input field may have focus indicator

**Queued Characters:**
- Blue position badge with queue position
- Queue position visible in both expanded and collapsed sidebar

**Eligible Characters:**
- Neutral position badge with predicted position
- Sorted by talkativeness (higher talkativeness = earlier position)

**Silent Characters:**
- Muted appearance with "Silent" badge
- Still receive turns (shown in turn order)
- Messages styled with dotted borders and muted tones

**Absent Characters:**
- Dimmed/greyed appearance
- No position badge
- Shown at the bottom of the participant list

### Turn Status Messages

The sidebar header shows current status:

- "Your turn to speak" — Ready for your input
- "Generating response..." — AI is creating a response
- "Waiting for [Character]..." — Waiting for LLM response
- "[Character] is thinking..." — Character actively generating
- "2 in queue" — Shows queue count if characters are queued

## Special Situations

### Single Active Character

When only one character is active:

- Normal "no repeat speaker" rule is suspended
- Character can speak multiple times in a row
- Creates a back-and-forth between you and one character

### All Characters Have Spoken

When everyone has responded:

- Turn manager signals your turn
- Characters wait for your next message
- Sending a message starts a new cycle

### User-Controlled Characters

Characters you're impersonating:

- Wait for your input on their turn
- Input field shows which character you're typing as
- Other LLM characters continue their turns normally
- You can queue impersonated characters for specific timing

### All-LLM Chats

When no characters are user-controlled:

- Characters take turns automatically
- No user input required between turns
- **Auto-pause** activates after several turns:
  - Prevents infinite conversation loops
  - Notification asks if you want to continue
  - Click Resume or Pause to control flow

### Characters with Zero Talkativeness

If talkativeness is set to 0:

- Character never volunteers to speak
- Can still be nudged or queued
- Useful for "background" characters who speak only when prompted

### All Remaining Characters at Zero

If all eligible characters have zero talkativeness:

- No one is automatically selected
- It becomes your turn (or the cycle ends)
- Use nudge or queue to make someone speak

## Pause and Resume

### For All-LLM Chats

**Pause:**

- Click **Pause** in sidebar header
- Characters stop responding
- Current generation (if any) completes
- Use to read, think, or take a break

**Resume:**

- Click **Resume** to continue
- Turn manager resumes normal operation
- Next eligible character speaks

### Auto-Pause

Triggers automatically when:

- Multiple LLM characters are active
- No user messages for several turns
- Prevents runaway conversations

You'll see a notification with options:

- **Resume** — Continue the conversation
- **Stop** — End auto-responses, take manual control

## Configuration

### Adjusting Talkativeness

1. Expand Participants Sidebar
2. Find character's card
3. Use the slider to adjust:
   - Drag left for quieter (speaks less)
   - Drag right for chattier (speaks more)
4. Changes apply immediately

### Turn Settings

Some turn behavior can be configured:

- **Auto-pause threshold** — How many turns before pausing all-LLM chats
- **Queue behavior** — Whether queue persists across your messages

Access these in Chat Settings if available.

## Troubleshooting

### Character never speaks

**Causes:**

- Talkativeness set to 0
- Character is inactive
- Character already spoke this cycle
- Connection profile issue

**Solutions:**

- Increase talkativeness slider
- Check Active status
- Wait for your turn, then send another message
- Use Nudge to force a response
- Verify connection profile is valid

### Same character always speaks first

**Causes:**

- Very high talkativeness compared to others
- Others have very low talkativeness
- Small sample size (random selection variance)

**Solutions:**

- Balance talkativeness across characters
- Use Queue to control specific order
- Raise other characters' talkativeness

### Queue not processing

**Causes:**

- Queued character is inactive
- Queued character has connection issues
- UI not updated

**Solutions:**

- Check character is active
- Verify connection profile works
- Refresh the page
- Clear queue and re-queue

### Turn indicator stuck

**Causes:**

- Generation failed silently
- Network issue
- Server problem

**Solutions:**

- Refresh the page
- Check network connection
- Try sending a new message
- Check if response eventually appears

### All-LLM chat won't pause

**Causes:**

- Pause threshold not reached
- Pause feature disabled
- Quick responses cycling fast

**Solutions:**

- Click Pause button manually
- Wait for auto-pause notification
- Refresh if button doesn't respond

## Tips for Effective Turn Management

### For Roleplay

- **Set protagonist high** — Main characters should talk more
- **Supporting cast lower** — Background characters chime in less
- **Use nudge for reactions** — When someone should specifically respond
- **Queue for set pieces** — Plan important conversation sequences

### For Group Dynamics

- **Balance talkativeness** — For equal ensemble participation
- **Vary by scene** — Adjust who's prominent based on scene focus
- **Mark absent** — Set characters not in the scene to Absent
- **Silence observers** — Use Silent for characters who should watch but not speak

### For Pacing

- **Pause to read** — Don't let scenes rush past
- **Queue for timing** — Set up dramatic reveals
- **Single character mode** — Focus on one-on-one within group chat

### For Cost Control

- **Fewer active characters** — Less API calls per cycle
- **Lower talkativeness** — Some characters speak less often
- **Pause between cycles** — Read before continuing
