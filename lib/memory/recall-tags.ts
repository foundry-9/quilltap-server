/**
 * Recall-side targeting-tag reading.
 *
 * The memory extractor (`lib/memory/cheap-llm-tasks/memory-tasks.ts`) materializes
 * three controlled targeting tags into every memory's `keywords` array:
 *   - temporal : bare word  — past | moment | present | future
 *   - scope    : `scope: narrow` | `scope: wide`
 *   - context  : bare word  — philosophy | relationships | history | banter |
 *                              mannerisms | trivia | information
 *
 * This module reads them back at recall time and turns them into bounded,
 * clamped multipliers on the already-computed blended recall score: scope+project
 * gating and temporal down-weighting (items 1–2) read the memory's own tags;
 * context steering and participant boost (items 3–4) compare against turn-level
 * signals carried on the RecallContext. It is the single source of truth for the
 * closed vocabularies — the extraction path imports the Sets from here, so the
 * two sides can never drift.
 *
 * Pure + I/O-free — no logging, no DB, no LLM — so it is trivially unit-testable
 * and safe to import from the forked job child.
