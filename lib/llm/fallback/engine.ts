/**
 * Fallback engine — trigger classification and chain building.
 *
 * Every connection profile gets an ordered chain of at most three attempts:
 *
 *   1. the profile itself,
 *   2. its configured understudy (`fallbackProfileId`),
 *   3. one auto-picked same-or-better-tier replacement, if `allowTierFallback`.
 *
 * Chains do **not** recurse. When profile A falls back to B, B's own
 * `fallbackProfileId` is not followed. That is what makes a cycle (A->B,
 * B->A) harmless config rather than an infinite loop, and it is why the worst
 * case is three calls no matter how the user has wired their profiles.
 *
 * There is no stickiness: a successful fallback applies to that call only.
 * The next message tries the primary again, so a transient outage heals
 * itself without the user having to notice it happened.
 *
