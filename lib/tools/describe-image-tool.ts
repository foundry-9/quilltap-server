/**
 * @fileoverview Tool definition for `describe_image` — the "what is actually
 * in this picture?" verb.
 *
 * Before this existed, a character's entire image vocabulary was custodial:
 * `keep_image` (file it away), `attach_image` (show it to the room again) and
 * `list_images` (what have I filed?). None of them answers the question a
 * character actually has when a picture lands in the chat, so models reached
 * for `attach_image` — the only one whose name sounds like engagement — and
 * got told to file the image first, which is filing advice in answer to a
 * looking question (bug 92).
 *
 * The description usually costs nothing: Quilltap-generated images carry the
 * prompt that made them, and chat uploads are auto-described on arrival
 * (`lib/photos/auto-describe-attachment.ts`). The handler prefers the prompt,
 * then the stored description, and only spends a vision call when neither
 * exists. The prompt outranks the stored column because that column has held
 * labels rather than descriptions for generated images (bug 132).
