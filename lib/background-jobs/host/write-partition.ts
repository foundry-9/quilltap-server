/**
 * Write-batch partitioning for the job applier (parent-side).
 *
 * A background-job handler runs in the forked child and buffers ALL of its
 * repository writes into one batch the parent applies. Those writes can target
 * three *separate* SQLite databases:
 *
 *   - the **main** DB (`quilltap.db`) — chats, characters, memories, folders,
 *     files, projects, background_jobs, embedding_status, vector indices, …
 *   - the dedicated **mount-index** DB (doc-store folders/files/links/chunks)
 *   - the dedicated **llm-logs** DB
 *
 * Before this module the applier wrapped the *whole* batch in a single
 * `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` on the **main** connection, then let mount-index / llm-logs
 * writes auto-commit statement-by-statement on their own connections inside
 * that loop. Two problems fell out of that shared fate:
 *
 *   1. A mount-index write failure (e.g. the cross-job concurrent folder
 *      create hitting the `(mountPointId, parentId, name)` unique index) rolled
 *      back the main-DB chat/run-state writes — poisoning an autonomous turn —
 *      while any mount-index rows already auto-committed before the throw
 *      *leaked* (they were never inside a transaction that could roll back).
 *   2. There was no atomicity for the mount-index / llm-logs portion at all.
 *
 * The applier now partitions a batch by target database and commits each
 * partition in its OWN transaction on its OWN connection, so a failure in one
 * database can neither roll back nor leak into another. This module holds the
 * pure (no-I/O, fully unit-testable) classification + partition logic.
