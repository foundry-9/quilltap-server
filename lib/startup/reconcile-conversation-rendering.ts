/**
 * Conversation render/embed reconciliation (startup self-heal)
 *
 * Re-enqueues a CONVERSATION_RENDER job for every chat the Scriptorium pipeline
 * left half-finished:
 *
 *   (A) a chat with real USER/ASSISTANT messages but no rendered Markdown — the
 *       per-turn render trigger never fired or the render job died (e.g. an
 *       interrupted shutdown), so `renderedMarkdown` is still NULL; or
 *   (B) a chat whose interchange chunks were never embedded — the embedding
 *       provider was down when the turn fired (Ollama/cloud outage), or the
 *       render job died before enqueuing the embeds, leaving chunks with a NULL
 *       `embedding` blob ("yellow" in the chat list) and no recovery path.
 *
 * Re-running CONVERSATION_RENDER heals both: the render handler upserts the
 * interchange chunks (preserving any embeddings already present) and re-enqueues
 * EMBEDDING_GENERATE for every chunk still lacking one.
 *
 * Why every startup (not a one-time backfill): the gap recurs. New chats slip
 * through whenever the embedder is unavailable mid-conversation, and a hard
 * shutdown can drop an in-flight render. So this is a recurring safety net. It
 * is a no-op on a healthy instance — one indexed scan that returns nothing and
 * enqueues nothing.
 *
 * Why ENQUEUE rather than render inline: a large backlog must not block the
 * startup loading screen, and `enqueueConversationRender` already dedupes
 * against any render job still pending for the chat, so repeated boots before
 * the queue drains can't pile up duplicate work.
 *
 * Oversized / empty chunks are EXCLUDED from the "needs work" test. A chunk
 * larger than {@link EMBEDDING_MAX_CHARS} (or empty) is deterministically
 * unembeddable today — the embedder marks it FAILED without retry, and oversized
 * interchanges await renderer-side sub-chunking. Counting them would keep their
 * chat perpetually "incomplete" and re-render it on every boot for nothing.
 *
 * STALE chats are EXCLUDED too, via the same shared `isStale` gate the
 * maintenance sweeps use. The stale-chat cache collapse deliberately
 * cold-tiers quiet chats into exactly the state this scan reads as damage —
 * NULL `renderedMarkdown`, NULL chunk embeddings — and expects the Salon
 * reopen path (`lib/scriptorium/cold-chunk-reembed.ts`) to re-embed on
 * demand. Before this exclusion the two subsystems fought: every boot
 * re-rendered and re-embedded the entire cold tier (thousands of paid
 * embedding calls), and the next sweep cleared it all again. A stale chat is
 * healed when it is actually reopened or played, not at startup.
 *
 * Runs in the parent (the sole DB writer), like the other startup self-heals,
 * so the enqueue writes land directly rather than buffering through the job
 * child.

/**
 * Chats that are not fully rendered + embedded, excluding chunks that can never
 * embed. The first `?` binds {@link EMBEDDING_MAX_CHARS}; the second binds the
 * current default embedding profile's id (or a sentinel matching nothing when
 * no profile exists). `updatedAt` rides along for the staleness gate's
 * no-played-messages fallback.
 *
 * The length guard alone is not enough: a chunk can sit under the 131,072-char
 * transport cap yet exceed the embedding model's token context (e.g. >8,192
 * tokens ≈ ~31k chars for text-embedding-3-large). Those fail deterministically
 * — `isPermanentEmbeddingError` marks them FAILED without retry — so any chunk
 * with a FAILED embedding_status for the profile the re-embed would actually
 * use is excluded from arm (B), or its chat would re-render and re-fail on
 * every boot.
 *
 * Arm (C) is the one exception that DOES pull those oversize chunks back in —
 * but only now that the renderer sub-chunks them (Bug 17). A chunk over the
 * per-chunk budget yet inside the transport cap predates interchange
 * sub-chunking; re-rendering splits it into in-context chunks that embed. This
 * is self-limiting (a re-rendered chat has no over-budget chunk left, so it
 * stops matching) and, like everything here, is gated by the stale-chat check
 * in the loop below — a cold-tiered chat is left for its reopen/next-played
 * heal, never resurrected at boot.
