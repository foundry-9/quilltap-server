/**
 * Bundle Dissolution
 *
 * A "bundle" is a wardrobe item with `componentItemIds` — Man in Black, the
 * House Livery, a three-piece suit. Equipped state used to keep the bundle's
 * own id in every slot it covered, expanding to leaf garments only at read
 * time. That made the wardrobe dialog read badly: the bundle showed as one
 * card and all four slot rows underneath said *Empty*, so nothing on screen
 * told you which shirt you actually had on.
 *
 * Putting a bundle on now dissolves it in the same gesture: the leaves go into
 * the slots their own `types` declare and the bundle's id is never stored.
 * There is no separate "Break apart" step for anything worn from here on (the
 * button survives for outfits equipped before this change, which still carry a
 * composite id).
 *
 * Dissolution is deliberately *total* — `expandComposites` walks to leaves, so
 * a bundle nested inside a bundle dissolves too and no bundle card can come
 * back. It is also fail-safe: an unresolvable bundle (components live in a
 * store this caller can't see) returns `null`, and callers fall back to
 * storing the bundle whole, exactly as before. Wearing something is never
 * allowed to resolve to wearing nothing.
