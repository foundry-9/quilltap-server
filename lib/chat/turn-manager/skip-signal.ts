 * "Nothing to add" turn-skipping — shared pure logic.

 * `escapeRegex`). It performs NO repository / filesystem access,
 * so it can run identically on the server (orchestrator, turn action), in the
 * forked background-jobs child, and in the Salon client for the Skip-button
 * guard.
 *
 * A pass is recorded as a Host message (`systemSender: 'host'`,
 * `systemKind: 'turn-pass'`, `hostEvent: { participantId }`) — no new state
 * columns. Every derivation below (last speaker, cycle membership, must-speak
 * guard) recomputes from that history.
