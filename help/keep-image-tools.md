# The Photo Album — Looking At, Keeping, Listing, and Re-Attaching Images

When a character generates an image in the Salon, that image is, by default, a passing thing. The chat is cleaned up after thirty days, the original file slips quietly into the void, and all that remains is a fond recollection. This is, as a rule, fine. But occasionally a character will produce a portrait, a backdrop, or an artefact of such evident merit that they should rather like to keep it about — to glance at it again later, to bring it up in conversation a fortnight hence, to file it tidily away under "covenant" or "the night we built the sunroom."

For these occasions Quilltap furnishes four brass-handled instruments: **`describe_image`**, **`keep_image`**, **`list_images`**, and **`attach_image`**.

A word on which is which, because the distinction has tripped up better minds than ours. Exactly one of them — **`describe_image`** — tells a character what a picture *contains*. The other three move it about: into the album, out of the album, or across the desk to be shown to the room. A character who wants to know what they are looking at should ask `describe_image` and nothing else.

## What's actually happening

A character's photo album is not a separate filing system. It is a directory called `photos/` inside the character's own document vault, the same vault that holds their wardrobe and their commonplace book. When the character keeps an image, the system makes a hard link to the existing image binary — no duplication of bytes — and writes a small Markdown document describing the photograph (the original generation prompt, a snapshot of the scene at the time, the caption the character wished to remember it by, and a freeform tag or two). That Markdown is what becomes searchable. A blind LLM (one that cannot itself perceive images) can therefore still reason about the picture, because the description and provenance ride along with it in plain English.

Because it's a hard link rather than a copy, the original image binary persists for as long as any link to it exists — including the link in the character's album. The thirty-day chat cleanup does not touch a kept image.

## The Tools

### `describe_image(uuid)`

Ask what is actually *in* a photograph — the only instrument on this shelf that answers that question.

The other three are custodial: `keep_image` files a picture away, `attach_image` takes it back out and holds it up, and `list_images` reads the catalogue. None of them shows the character anything. `describe_image` does, and it is the one to reach for whenever a character finds themselves squinting at a UUID and wondering what it depicts.

Pass any handle the character happens to be holding — the uuid from a Librarian upload announcement, the id `generate_image` returned, the catalogue handle from an Aurora or Lantern announcement, or an album link uuid from `list_images`. The image need **not** be in the character's own album; looking at a thing is not the same as owning it, and the tool declines to pretend otherwise.

The answer is usually instantaneous and costs nothing at all, because the description has generally been written already:

1. **The prompt that made it.** For an image Quilltap generated — a Lantern backdrop, an Aurora portrait, a `generate_image` commission — the commissioning prompt is the most faithful description available, and it is free for the asking. It is consulted first, ahead of anything else filed on the picture; should the file also carry a description of its own, that comes along too, marked *On file*.
2. **A description filed at upload.** Every image the user uploads into a chat is described on arrival by the configured vision profile, and that account is kept on the file itself.
3. **A fresh look.** Only when neither exists does the tool send the picture to the vision profile — and the result is filed, so the next character to ask is served from step 2.

Earlier editions of the house stamped a label onto every generated picture — "Story background for: *such-and-such*", or "*Name* — wardrobe portrait" — in the very slot the tool reads as a description, and served it as one. A character asking what a backdrop showed was told the title of the conversation. Those labels are no longer written, existing ones are cleared when the house next opens, and the prompt now takes precedence regardless.

A character whose own eyes read pictures (a vision-capable model, handed the image directly with the message) does not strictly need this — but may still call it, and often should, when they want the particulars set down in words rather than merely glimpsed.

### `keep_image(uuid, caption?, tags?)`

Save an image to the calling character's photo album. Pass:

- **`uuid`** — the UUID of the image to save. The character receives one when they generate the image; it also appears in any prior `list_images` result.
- **`caption`** — optional. A short, human-flavoured phrase the character wants to remember the image by (e.g. *"the night we built the sunroom"*).
- **`tags`** — optional. Freeform retrieval labels (e.g. `["covenant", "sunroom"]`). These are not the platform's global Tag system — they exist purely to help the character find this photograph later by semantic similarity.

If the character has already kept this image, `keep_image` declines politely with the path of the existing copy. To amend a caption or tag set, delete the existing copy first (with `doc_delete_file`) and keep the image afresh.

### `list_images(query?, tags?, saved_by?, limit?, offset?)`

List photographs in the character's album, with optional semantic search and filters.

- **`query`** — a freeform phrase. The system embeds it and ranks against the prompt + scene + caption + tags of each kept image.
- **`tags`** — restrict to images bearing any of these tags.
- **`saved_by`** — restrict to images saved by a particular character (by name or id). Mostly useful when Shared Vaults is on and the chat contains characters who can see each other's albums.
- **`limit`** / **`offset`** — pagination. Defaults: 20 results per page from the beginning.

If Shared Vaults is enabled for the chat and the participating characters have `systemTransparency`, their albums become visible to one another. Otherwise each character sees only their own.

### `attach_image(uuid)`

Take a photograph the character has already kept and hold it up to the room again — render it inline in the conversation, attached to their reply. Pass the UUID returned by `list_images` (the album link uuid) or the original image-v2 uuid. The system resurfaces the image with its caption and tag set, attaching the descriptor to the outgoing reply.

**This does not let the character see the picture.** It is a gesture outward, toward everyone else in the room. A character who wants to know what the photograph shows wants `describe_image`.

A character can only attach images from their own album. If they wish to share a photograph another character has kept, they must keep their own copy first.

## How the character knows the UUID

Whenever a fresh image is announced in chat — a new portrait commissioned by Aurora, a backdrop projected by the Lantern, an ad-hoc picture from `generate_image`, or an image the user has uploaded as an attachment — the announcement message in the transcript names the file's UUID inline (catalogued thus: "...uuid `abc-123-...`..."). The character can simply read it off the page and feed it to `describe_image` (to find out what it shows) or `keep_image` (to file it). Library shelves are well-labelled, and so are these.

## Where the bytes live

- The image binary lives once, in `doc_mount_blobs`, shared by every link to it.
- The character's album link lives in `doc_mount_file_links` under `<characterVault>/photos/`.
- The link's `extractedText` carries the Markdown context document — YAML frontmatter (tags, `linkedBy`, `linkedById`, `generationModel`), the prompt, the revised prompt if present and different, a scene snapshot from `chat.sceneState` at keep-time, and a closing attribution line.
- The Markdown is chunked and embedded inline, so the character's vault search picks it up automatically. No new search source, no new filter — just ask the character about their photographs.

## Enabling and Disabling

The four photo album tools live in the same group as the document editing tools — gated by the **Document Editing** toggle in the chat tool settings. Disabling that group disables the photo album tools as well.
