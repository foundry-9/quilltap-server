# Custom Tools — Pascal's Table

> **[Open this setting in Quilltap](/settings?tab=chat&section=custom-tools)**

There comes a moment in every story when the outcome ought not to be anybody's decision. Can she pick the lock? Does the detector register anything at all? What, precisely, does one draw from a deck of many things? You could decide. Your characters could decide. But a story in which the interesting questions are settled by whoever is most eager to settle them is not, in the end, a story with much suspense in it.

This is what Pascal the Croupier is for. A **custom tool** is a small contrivance of your own design — a named action, a roll of chance, and a table telling Pascal what each result means. You write it once, as a modest JSON document. Thereafter your characters may reach for it, and so may you, and neither of you gets to argue with the wheel.

**The wheel cannot be argued with.** This is the entire point, so it bears stating plainly: the roll happens on the server, and Pascal announces the outcome himself, in his own message. Your characters do not write that message. A model that would dearly love to have picked the lock will find the lock has not been picked, and will have to go on from there. Regenerating a reply does not spin again — a roll, once fallen, has fallen.

## Where the tools live

Pascal looks for a folder called `Tools` at the top of any document store, and reads every file in it whose name ends in `.tool.json`. One tool per file.

The folder is not made for you and need not exist; if you want one, simply create `Tools/` in a store and put a file in it. The filename itself carries no weight — a tool's identity is the `name` inside it, so `lockpicking.tool.json` may perfectly well contain a tool named `unlock`.

## A first tool

Here is a complete one. Copy it, put it in `Tools/unlock.tool.json` in any store your character can reach, and it is available immediately — there is nothing to restart and no button to press.

> Should you prefer to see every key at once rather than meet them one at a time, there is an annotated specimen at `docs/developer/CUSTOM_TOOL_SPEC.json` that exercises the lot, and a dice-form companion beside it at `docs/developer/CUSTOM_TOOL_SPEC_DICE.json`. Both are valid and may be copied wholesale.

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/qtap-custom-tool.schema.json",
  "name": "unlock",
  "description": "Attempt to pick the lock.",
  "parameters": {
    "bonus": {
      "type": "number",
      "default": 0,
      "description": "Skill bonus added to the roll.",
      "min": 0,
      "max": 10
    }
  },
  "roll": { "min": 0, "max": 1, "offset": { "$param": "bonus" } },
  "outcomes": [
    { "when": { "gt": 0.60 }, "message": "The lock clicks open.",   "state": "success" },
    { "when": { "lt": 0.30 }, "message": "Still locked.",            "state": "failure" },
    { "when": true,           "message": "The lock is giving way…",  "state": "partial"  }
  ]
}
```

That `$schema` line at the top is worth keeping. It is what lets a decent text editor complete the field names for you and complain before Quilltap has to.

### `title` — what the thing is called in polite company

The `name` is the tool's identity: lowercase, no spaces, and the string your characters actually call. It is not, however, a thing anyone wants to read. Add a `title` and Pascal will announce that instead:

```json
{ "name": "scan_hawking_radiation", "title": "Scan Hawking Radiation" }
```

Omit it and Quilltap derives one from the name — underscores and hyphens become spaces, and each word is given its capital — which for the example above produces precisely the same string, and for a great many tools will do perfectly well. Write a `title` when the derivation isn't what you'd have said yourself: `saving_throw` might be *Save vs. the House*.

Your characters never see the title. They know the tool as `unlock` and ask for it by that name, which spares them the confusion of a thing with two names and spares you a model that guesses wrong about which one to use.

### `description` — write it for the story, not for the machinery

This is the single most consequential sentence in the file, because it is how a character decides whether this tool is the thing they want. Write what the tool *does in the fiction*: "Attempt to pick the lock." Do not write what it does arithmetically: "rolls 0–1 against thresholds." Your character is picking a lock; they are not consulting a probability distribution, and describing it as one is a reliable way to get stilted results.

### `parameters` — optional, and always optional in practice

Up to eight, each with a name, a `type` (`number`, `integer`, `string`, or `boolean`), and — required, without exception — a `default`. The default is required so that a character who reaches for the tool without thinking too hard about it still gets a sensible roll rather than an error.

On numeric parameters you may set `min` and `max`. These are not suggestions: a value arriving from anywhere is clamped into that range before it is used for anything. A character feeling optimistic about a `bonus` of 900 will find it has become 10.

### `roll` — two ways to leave it to chance

**A range.** A number drawn evenly between `min` and `max` (0 and 1 if you don't say), then put through a small, fixed transformation:

```
value = raw × multiplier
value = value + offset
if round: value = the nearest whole number
```

That order matters and does not vary. Any of `min`, `max`, `multiplier`, and `offset` may be a plain number or `{ "$param": "bonus" }`, referring to one of your numeric parameters. This is the only indirection the format has — there are no formulas, no expressions, and nothing that gets evaluated. You will find this restriction generous rather than mean: it means a typo is caught when the file loads, not three hours into a scene.

**Dice.** Or simply write dice, as dice are written:

```json
{ "roll": "1d20" }
```

`3d6+2`, `2d10-1`, `d20` — all understood, modifiers and all, rolled by the same dice Quilltap rolls everywhere else. Between 2 and 1000 sides, up to 100 of them. With dice, the value your outcomes test against is the total, modifier included.

If you leave `roll` out altogether, you get a plain number between 0 and 1.

### `outcomes` — an ordered table, first match wins

Each entry has a `when`, a `message`, and a `state`.

`when` is either the word `true` — meaning "anything" — or a small object of comparisons: `gt`, `gte`, `lt`, `lte`, `eq`, `neq`. Several in one object must *all* hold, so a middling band is written:

```json
{ "when": { "gte": 0.30, "lte": 0.60 }, "message": "…", "state": "partial" }
```

There is deliberately no "or". You will not need it: the table is read from the top and the first entry that matches wins, so ordering says everything an "or" would have said, and says it more legibly.

#### Asking about more than the number

Written bare like that, the comparisons are about the rolled value. Two other things may be asked about in the same breath, and everything you name must hold:

| | |
|---|---|
| bare `gt`, `gte`, … | the final value, after the transformation |
| `roll` | the raw number, *before* it |
| `params` | what the tool was actually called with, by parameter name |

So *"the value exceeded 1, and the scale was set past 12"* is written:

```json
{ "when": { "gt": 1, "params": { "scale": { "gt": 12 } } }, "message": "…", "state": "success" }
```

`roll` earns its keep when a multiplier or an offset has carried the value some distance from what the dice actually did — a raw draw in the bottom fiftieth is a fumble whatever you have since multiplied it by, and only `roll` can say so.

`params` will compare numbers with any of the six, and will compare a string or a boolean with `eq` and `neq` — `{ "params": { "material": { "eq": "brass" } } }` is a perfectly good question. It will not pretend to *order* a string: asking whether `"brass"` is greater than 1 is refused when the file loads rather than quietly never happening.

A comparison may also be made against a parameter instead of a number you fixed in advance, by writing `{ "$param": "difficulty" }` where the number would go. This is the opposed check, and it is written thus:

```json
{ "when": { "gte": { "$param": "difficulty" } }, "message": "Beaten, by exactly enough.", "state": "success" }
```

Still no formulas, still nothing evaluated — only a flat list of comparisons, all of which must hold. It is a smaller box than you might like for about a week, and a considerable comfort thereafter.

**The last outcome must be `true`.** Quilltap insists, and refuses to load a tool that ends any other way. The reason is that a table with a gap in it is a table that will one day produce a roll matching nothing at all, at the worst possible moment, in front of everybody. Requiring a catch-all at the end makes that impossible rather than merely unlikely. For the same reason, a `true` anywhere *except* the end is refused too — everything below it could never be reached, which is never what anyone meant.

`state` is one of `success`, `partial`, `failure`, or `info`. It tints Pascal's announcement accordingly. You never write any styling yourself.

### Putting things in the message

Four things may be dropped into a `message`:

| | |
|---|---|
| `{{value}}` | the final number, after the transformation |
| `{{roll}}` | the raw number, before it |
| `{{dice}}` | the dice breakdown, e.g. `3d6+2: [4, 2, 6] + 2 = 14` (empty if you're not rolling dice) |
| `{{params.bonus}}` | a parameter, as it was actually used — after defaulting and clamping |

Anything else in braces is left exactly as you typed it.

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/qtap-custom-tool.schema.json",
  "name": "measure_hawking_radiation",
  "description": "Take a Hawking-radiation reading from the detector.",
  "parameters": {
    "baseline": { "type": "number", "default": 0,       "description": "Lowest plausible reading." },
    "ceiling":  { "type": "number", "default": 1000000, "description": "Highest plausible reading." }
  },
  "roll": { "min": { "$param": "baseline" }, "max": { "$param": "ceiling" }, "round": true },
  "outcomes": [
    { "when": true, "message": "The detector reads {{value}} µK.", "state": "info" }
  ]
}
```

And a tool that rolls honest dice:

```json
{
  "$schema": "/schemas/qtap-custom-tool.schema.json",
  "name": "saving_throw",
  "description": "Roll a d20 saving throw against DC 12.",
  "roll": "1d20",
  "outcomes": [
    { "when": { "gte": 12 }, "message": "Saved! ({{dice}})",  "state": "success" },
    { "when": true,          "message": "Failed. ({{dice}})", "state": "failure" }
  ]
}
```

## Which tool wins: the matter of tiers

The same tool name may reasonably exist in several stores, and Quilltap resolves the question by proximity. Nearest to the character wins:

**their own vault → another participant's vault → a group store → a project store → Quilltap General**

So an `unlock` in a character's own vault quietly supersedes the project's `unlock`, for that character only. This is how one gives a locksmith better odds than everybody else without anybody else noticing.

To switch off an inherited tool rather than replace it, define it nearer and mark it `"disabled": true`:

```json
{ "name": "unlock", "description": "Not for this one.", "disabled": true,
  "outcomes": [{ "when": true, "message": "-", "state": "info" }] }
```

The name is then suppressed at that tier and every tier beyond it.

If two stores at the *same* distance both define a name, Quilltap picks one deterministically and notes the fact — but this is a coin-toss you did not intend to write, and is worth tidying up.

## Rolling in secret

Some rolls should not be public knowledge. Set `"defaultVisibility": "whisper"` and Pascal will whisper the outcome to the character who rolled, and to nobody else — the other characters' contexts simply do not contain it. A character may also whisper a single roll by asking privately, and you may tick **Roll privately** in the popup, which hides the outcome from every character at once.

**You always see it.** Whoever the whisper is for, it renders for you. This establishment has one proprietor, and there is nothing to be gained by keeping you in the dark about your own dice.

## On keeping the odds to yourself

Set `"revealOdds": false` and a character is told only the tool's name, its description, and its parameters. The roll spec and the outcome table are withheld — they know they may attempt the lock; they do not know what it takes.

**One honest caveat, which you should read before relying on this.** `revealOdds` hides the odds from the *tool listing*. It does not make the file secret. A `.tool.json` is an ordinary document in an ordinary store, and a character with read access to that store can simply open it and read the odds for themselves, as they could any other document.

If the odds must genuinely be secret, put the file in a store the character cannot read. Quilltap's per-document and per-store permissions already do this properly; `revealOdds` is a courtesy, not a lock.

## Rolling one yourself

When a scene has any custom tools, a button appears in the composer's left-hand gutter. It lists what's available, with a small form for any parameters (already filled in with their defaults), a **Roll privately** tick, and a Run button.

Rolling this way posts one thing: the outcome, exactly as it would have appeared had a character rolled it themselves. Pascal is a croupier and not a raconteur — he lays out the result and says nothing else about it.

**Which means nothing records that it was you.** Should you nudge a parameter before rolling, that is between you and the wheel: the transcript does not note that the operator reached for the tool, nor what figures you chose, and no character can read what you did to arrange the odds. They see what befell. This seems to us the correct division of information.

Should a tool be defined differently for different characters, you'll see each variant listed with the character's name beside it, and running it rolls that character's version.

## When something is wrong with a file

A tool that cannot be loaded is simply left out of the roster, and appears in the popup with a badge explaining why. It is never half-loaded and never guessed at. Common causes: the JSON doesn't parse; the last outcome isn't `true`; a `$param` names a parameter that doesn't exist, or one that isn't a number; an outcome asks after a parameter you never declared, or asks whether a string is greater than a number; the dice notation has a typo; two files in the same store claim the same name.

Misspelled keys are refused too, rather than ignored. A `when` containing `gt3` is not a `when` with an eccentric extra key in it; it is a comparison you meant to make and didn't, and had Quilltap shrugged and loaded the file, that outcome would have sat in your table for months looking like a branch that simply never comes up.

If a roll fails while it's actually running — a bound that ended up above its own ceiling, say — **Prospero** reports it, not Pascal. Pascal announces outcomes, and only outcomes. A roll that didn't happen doesn't get one.

## Limits

Sixty-four tools per scene, eight parameters and thirty-two outcomes per tool, a thousand characters per message, five hundred per description, eighty per title. If a scene somehow exceeds the roster limit, the surplus is dropped and said so out loud — never silently.

## Turning it off

The **Custom tools** setting on Settings → Chat governs the whole arrangement. Switched off, `run_custom` is never offered to any model and the gutter button goes away. Your files stay exactly where they are.

## In-Chat Navigation

Characters with help tools enabled can navigate directly to this setting:

`help_navigate(url: "/settings?tab=chat&section=custom-tools")`
