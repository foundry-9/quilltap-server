# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository. This file is loaded on every turn, so it stays short and points at deeper docs. **The rules in "Standing rules" below are not optional — follow them on every task.**

## Project Overview

Quilltap is a self-hosted AI workspace for writers, worldbuilders, roleplayers, and anyone who wants an AI assistant that actually knows what they're working on. Connect to any LLM provider, organize work into projects with persistent files and context, create characters with real personalities, and build a private AI environment that learns and remembers.

- **Already implemented:** see the [README](README.md).
- **Roadmap:** `docs/developer/features/`; completed work in `docs/developer/features/complete/`.

## Standing rules (apply on every task)

### Spelling — non-negotiable

The project is **"Quilltap"** (quill + tap), **never** "Quilttap" (quilt + tap). An ESLint rule enforces this in JS/TS, and `npm run lint` also sweeps every other tracked file — docs included. Never write "quilttap" anywhere.

### Writing voice

- **User-facing** writing (UI, help docs, prompts, migration loading-screen labels) is in the style of *steampunk + Roaring 20s + Great Gatsby + Wodehouse + Lemony Snicket*.
- **`docs/CHANGELOG.md` is the exception:** terse, direct, plain American English. No steampunk voice.

### Before committing

- Record changes in `docs/CHANGELOG.md` (reverse chronological, plain voice — see above).
- **All user-visible changes MUST be documented in `help/*.md`.** Help files need a `url` frontmatter field (with `?tab=`/`&section=` for settings deep-links) and an "In-Chat Navigation" section whose `help_navigate(url: "...")` call matches that `url`.
- Keep the docs listed in [update-documentation](/.claude/commands/update-documentation.md) current; update that file if you add docs.
- Linting, testing, type-checking, and version bumps are handled by the [/commit](/.claude/commands/commit.md) command. The `.githooks/pre-commit` hook kills the dev server, cleans `.next`, stops watchman, and stages dependency artifacts.
- Check TypeScript with **`npx tsc`**, not `npm run build`.

### Filing bugs

Defects worth recording live in the bug catalogue, indexed by
[docs/developer/bugs.md](docs/developer/bugs.md).

- **One bug, one file.** Open: `docs/developer/bugs/bug-<n>-<short-title>.md`.
  Fixed: the same file `git mv`d into `docs/developer/bugs/fixed/`, keeping its
  number. `<short-title>` is a two-or-three-word dashed description of the
  *problem* (`bug-9-store-delete-orphans.md`).
- **Numbers are permanent and sequential** — a new bug takes the next unused one.
- **Each file opens with a metadata table** (Status, Found, Fixed, Severity, Who
  it bites, Provenance, Fix site, v5 status, link back to the index), then states
  symptom, root cause with file and line, why it survived, the fix, and how to
  verify. A fixed entry keeps its full write-up plus a leading
  **`FIXED in v4 (date)`** paragraph.
- **The index's Status table is the register.** Filing or fixing a bug means
  updating *both* the bug's file and its row there. Never delete an entry.

### Hard stops (ask first / never work around)

- **`packages/` changes:** bump the version, then **stop and ask the human to `npm publish`** before installing. Never hand-copy package contents into place. If publish fails, fix the npm problem — don't work around it. **Exception — `packages/quilltap` (the CLI):** still bump its version, but don't ask for a manual `npm publish`; it publishes automatically at release.
- **Plugin changes:** bump the patch version in `package.json` (and `manifest.json` if needed), then re-run `npm run build:plugins` before staging. That build now typechecks each plugin first (`tsc -p tsconfig.json`, extending [`plugins/tsconfig.base.json`](./plugins/tsconfig.base.json)) and fails on any error — the root `npx tsc` excludes `plugins/`, so this is the only thing checking plugin types. A new plugin needs its own `tsconfig.json` extending that base plus a `typecheck` script.
- **Release (`tag-for-release`):** only after the human confirms they've walked the [release checklist](./docs/developer/DEVELOPMENT.md#checklist-before-release). Don't initiate it yourself.
- **No stubs or `TODO` code** unless agreed in advance.
- **Database writes via the CLI** use `--write` (lock-gated). Never use `--lock-override`.

### Code-path chokepoints (don't bypass)

- **Memory deletion** goes through `deleteMemoryWithUnlink(id)` / `deleteMemoriesWithUnlinkBatch(ids)` in `lib/memory/memory-gate.ts` — they scrub deleted IDs from neighbours' `relatedMemoryIds` first. Never call `repos.memories.delete*` directly. (Mirror of `createMemoryWithGate` on the write side.)
- **Tool definitions in `lib/tools/`:** the Zod input schema is the single source of truth. Export `xxxToolInputSchema`, derive `parameters` via `zodToOpenAISchema(...)`, and make `validateXxxInput` a one-line `safeParse(...).success` delegate. **Never hand-write the `parameters` JSON Schema or duplicate validation** — they drift. Field descriptions go on `.describe()`; extra checks on `.refine()`. Register new tools in `lib/tools/__tests__/tool-definitions-snapshot.test.ts` and run `npx jest -u` on it.
- **API routes:** new routes only under `/api/v1/` with the action-dispatch pattern (see below). Use middleware from `@/lib/api/middleware` and helpers from `@/lib/api/responses`.
- **Archived characters are tombstones.** A pruned vault is still live and writable, so the guards are the only thing keeping an archived character from being edited back into existence. `validateCharacterArchivePatch` (`lib/database/repositories/characters.repository.ts`) sanctions exactly one patch on an archived row — `{ archivedAt: null }` — and refuses everything else with `CharacterArchivedError`. Any new path that reaches a character's vault must respect the tombstone the way `resolveSelfVaultMountPointId` (`lib/doc-edit/path-resolver.ts`, returns null) and `resolveWardrobeMount` (`lib/database/repositories/vault-overlay/wardrobe-writes.ts`, throws) already do — never fall back to a legacy DB write path, and never call `ensureCharacterVault` on one. Archive/rehydrate themselves go through `lib/characters/archive-service.ts`; bundle crypto lives in `archive-crypto.ts` and must use the passphrase cache (`lib/startup/passphrase-cache.ts`), never `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_PEPPER`.
- **Realtime hints are parent-process only, and never carry data.** `publishRealtime(topic, id?)` (`lib/realtime/bus.ts`) says *what changed*; the client re-reads through the REST API. Publishing from the forked job child is a no-op by design — a child's changes surface from the parent chokepoints (`dispatchInvalidations`, `topicsForCompletedJob`, the activity mirror). **A new polling site is a bug:** publish a topic and gate the interval with `useRealtimeRefetchInterval` / `useRealtimeTopic` so the poll is only the offline fallback. A new `queryKeys` namespace means considering a row in `REALTIME_TOPICS` (`lib/schemas/realtime.types.ts`) and `lib/realtime/topic-map.ts`. Both WebSocket handlers authenticate through `lib/realtime/upgrade-auth.ts` — never hand-roll upgrade auth, and a new handler module needs its own esbuild line in `scripts/build-standalone-overlay.mjs` or it works in dev and vanishes from the tarball. Design of record: [features/complete/realtime-updates.md](docs/developer/features/complete/realtime-updates.md).
- **Folder rows in the legacy `folders` table** are created through `FoldersRepository.ensureByPath` — never `folders.create` for a path that may already exist. A `(userId, COALESCE(projectId,''), path)` unique index backs it, and it resolves a constraint violation to the row that won. Six hand-rolled `findByPath` → `create` guards is how the table grew 607 rows for 24 folders (bug 114): `findByPath` returns `null` on read *failure* as well as absence, and the check and the insert are not atomic across concurrent jobs. Restore is the one sanctioned `create` caller, because it must preserve ids.
- **A chat's Concierge posture is four states, never raw columns.** `conciergeOverride` and `isDangerousChat` are storage, not the question anyone is asking. Derive the state with `getConciergeState` (`lib/services/dangerous-content/chat-override.ts`) and ask the specific question with `shouldUseUncensoredRoute`, `shouldShowDangerStyling` or `isClassifierOnDuty` — never re-read the columns, and never revive the overloaded predicate that answered all three at once. Every transition goes through `applyConciergeFlip` (`lib/services/dangerous-content/manual-flip.ts`), the one chokepoint that maps the requested state onto its writes and posts the Concierge's announcement; it is a no-op when the state already matches. Chat creation applies it *after* the system-prompt message and *before* the greeting, so the greeting is composed under the chosen state.
- **Provider fallback is the engine's to build, not a call site's.** Import from `lib/llm/fallback` (never the modules under it) and use `classifyFallbackTrigger` / `buildFallbackChain` / `recordAttempt` / `summarizeFallbackAttempts`. A chain is at most three attempts — the profile, its `fallbackProfileId` understudy, one tier pick when `allowTierFallback` — and **does not recurse**, which is what makes an A→B, B→A configuration harmless rather than an infinite loop. Fallback is never sticky: the next call tries the primary again. Both steps require vision when the turn carries images, since a chain reuses the primary's message array. A new fallback site means calling the engine, not hand-rolling a second chain.
- **Derived progression state comes from `lib/progressions/`, never a call site.** `parseProgressions` / `deriveProgression` / `shouldReportProgression` / `renderProgressionReport` (`engine.ts`, pure and client-safe with an injected clock) are the only place elapsed / remaining / percent are computed; `buildProgressionsSection` (`prompt-section.ts`) is the one prompt-side reader and `flattenProgressions` the one Pascal-side one. **Never re-derive any of it inline.** `progressions` is the single reserved key in a character's vault `metadata.json` — validated at the point of use (`schema.ts` is the Zod source of truth, `public/schemas/qtap-progression.schema.json` its published mirror), never at hydration, and a malformed entry is dropped alone with a `warn` rather than hollowing the character. Cadence is derived from message history (`findLastOwnTurnMs`, beside the Core whisper's own cadence) and **never stored** — no writes on the prompt path. The report is a trailing per-turn section: it must never enter system block 1, and neither builder version is bumped by it. Pascal effect writes fold into the existing single metadata replace, so the job-child contract is untouched. Design of record: [features/character-progressions.md](docs/developer/features/character-progressions.md).
- **Excluding files from `.qtap` exports** goes through the one predicate in `lib/export/excluded-files.ts` (`EXPORT_EXCLUDED_FILE_CATEGORIES` / `EXPORT_EXCLUDED_FOLDER_PATHS` / `isFileExcludedFromExport`), used by the writer's file streamer, the export-type id resolver, and the wizard's entity picker. Never hand-roll a category check at a call site — a bundle that escapes one of the three rides inside every export, base64-inflated.

### Conventions

- **Logging:** every new or touched backend path fires debug logs, with appropriate levels elsewhere, via the built-in logging system.
- **Data/schema changes:** check whether they must be reflected in `.qtap`/SillyTavern exports, [`qtap-export.schema.json`](./public/schemas/qtap-export.schema.json), backups, and/or `migrations/`. Update [DDL.md](docs/developer/DDL.md) — it must stay current. Files kept only for migrations belong in `migrations/`.
- **Linting:** don't swap HTML `<img>` for Next.js `<Image>` — `<img>` is deliberate where sources come from APIs Next.js can't pre-resolve.
- **Next.js (16+) — don't reach for old-version patterns:** App Router only (`app/`, no `pages/` dir). There's no `middleware.ts`; cross-cutting request handling (security headers, CORS — *not* auth, which is single-user) lives in `proxy.ts` on the Edge runtime. Request APIs are async: `await cookies()` / `await headers()`, and route `params` / `searchParams` are Promises (`await params`). Don't write the old synchronous forms or look for conventions that moved.
- **Migrations** have extra rules (loading-screen labels + progress reporting) — see [Writing migrations](#writing-migrations).
- **Principles:** encapsulation, single source of truth (prefer inheritance over duplication), SRP, DRY, KISS, YAGNI.

### Working environment

- Dev runs via `npm run dev` (nearly always running, holds the instance lock) at `http://localhost:3000/`. Track it by tailing `logs/combined.log` (UTC timestamps).
- macOS dev: account for BSD tool variants; GNU coreutils and `gnu-sed` are installed under `g`-prefixed names (`gsed`, etc.).
- **Planning large changes:** plan with your most capable model and aggressively delegate well-specified subtasks to cheaper agent models (e.g. plan in Opus, delegate to Haiku). Don't use `git stash` or worktrees with agents — it tends to make a mess.

## Technology Stack

- **Framework / language:** React via Next.js, TypeScript, npm.
- **Testing:** Jest (native coverage) and Playwright.
- **Data:** SQLite + SQLCipher encryption at rest via `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers`, **aliased as `better-sqlite3`** in the root `package.json`. Runtime and tests `require('better-sqlite3')`, not the native name (which only resolves where a sub-package declares it directly). Tests needing both should fall back `better-sqlite3-multiple-ciphers` → `better-sqlite3`. Models are TS interfaces with Zod schemas.
- **File storage:** local filesystem only.
- **LLM providers:** OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok (xAI), Google, Ollama, OpenRouter, any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
- **Design docs:** Storybook. **User docs:** `/help/`, searchable via MessagePack.
- **Electron shell:** separate repo ([quilltap-shell](https://github.com/foundry-9/quilltap-shell)); this repo produces the standalone tarball it consumes.
- **Native modules:** `better-sqlite3` (node-gyp) and `sharp` (platform binaries). Both need special handling in standalone/Docker builds. New native modules → update `next.config.js` (`serverExternalPackages` + `outputFileTracingIncludes`).
- **Background jobs:** forked child process; parent is the only DB writer. See [Background jobs](#background-jobs-summary).

## API Architecture

All new routes live under `/api/v1/`:

- **Collection:** `/api/v1/[resource]` · **Item:** `/api/v1/[resource]/[id]` · **System:** `/api/v1/system/[feature]`

Use the `?action=` query parameter instead of per-action routes:

```ts
import { createContextHandler, withActionDispatch } from '@/lib/api/middleware';

// POST /api/v1/characters/[id]?action=favorite
export const POST = createContextHandler<{ id: string }>(
  withActionDispatch({ favorite: handleFavorite, avatar: handleAvatar }, handleDefaultPost)
);
```

- **Context:** `createContextHandler` / `withContext` (`@/lib/api/middleware`)
- **Action dispatch:** `withActionDispatch` / `withCollectionActionDispatch` (`@/lib/api/middleware/actions`)
- **Responses:** `successResponse`, `errorResponse`, `notFound`, `badRequest`, `validationError`, `created`, … (`@/lib/api/responses`)

Legacy non-v1 routes were removed in v2.8. Exceptions that remain: `/api/health`, `/api/plugin-routes/[...path]`, `/api/themes/*`. Note content/character/chat **API** paths stay at `/api/v1/characters`, `/api/v1/chats`, `/api/v1/projects` even though their UI routes were renamed (below). Full reference: [API.md](docs/developer/API.md).

## Client data fetching (TanStack Query)

Client server-state runs on **TanStack Query v5** (`@tanstack/react-query`); SWR is fully removed. `<QueryProvider>` (`lib/query/QueryProvider.tsx`) is the top-level provider. See the completed [migration spec](docs/developer/features/complete/tanstack-query-migration.md).

- **Query keys are the single source of truth.** Never pass a raw string/array key to `useQuery`/`useMutation`/`invalidateQueries` — always go through the factory in `lib/query/keys.ts` (e.g. `queryKeys.characters.detail(id)`). Prefix invalidation (`invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.characters.all })`) depends on it. Add a block when you introduce a new entity.
- **Fetcher:** `apiFetch<T>(url, init?)` from `lib/query/fetcher.ts` as the `queryFn`, forwarding the signal: `queryFn: ({ signal }) => apiFetch<T>(url, { signal })`. Throws `ApiFetchError` (`status` + parsed `info`) on non-2xx.
- **Mutations** use `useMutation` with `onSuccess`/`onSettled` invalidation; optimistic updates via `onMutate` + `setQueryData` + rollback in `onError`.
- **Tests** wrap with `renderWithQuery` / `createQueryWrapper` from `__tests__/helpers/renderWithQuery.tsx` (fresh client, retries off, `gcTime: 0`); `fetch` stays mocked via `jest-fetch-mock`.
- The Salon's SSE streaming transport is **out of scope** — migrate the reads *around* streaming, never the stream itself.

## Glossary

### Feature names (UI route · settings)

| Name | What it is |
|---|---|
| **The Salon** | chat interface — `/salon` |
| **Aurora** | characters UI (`/aurora`) + roleplay templates (`/settings?tab=templates`) |
| **Prospero** | agentic / tool-use systems — `/prospero`; `/settings?tab=system` |
| **The Scriptorium** | external document stores / mountable knowledge — `/scriptorium` (API stays `/api/v1/mount-points`) |
| **The Foundry** | architecture, plugins, packages — `/settings` (tabs from `lib/foundry/subsystem-defaults.ts`) |
| **Calliope** | UX/UI + themes — `/settings?tab=appearance` |
| **The Commonplace Book** | character memory (self-managed RAG) — `/settings?tab=memory` |
| **The Lantern** | story-background / image subsystem — `/settings?tab=images` |
| **The Concierge** | dangerous-content tracking/rerouting — `/settings?tab=chat` |
| **Pascal the Croupier** | RNG / game-state — `/settings?tab=chat`; custom-tool editor **Pascal's Workbench** — `/custom-tools` |
| **Saquel Ytzama** | encryption / secrets / API keys — `/settings?tab=system` |
| **The Librarian** | synthetic author for Document-Mode events + character `doc_*` calls |
| **The Host** | synthetic author for Salon participation + autonomous-room events |
| **Carina** | inline LLM queries (`@Name:` / `@Name?` / `ask_carina`) — see [Carina](#carina-summary) |
| **The Almanack** | the system report (formerly "capabilities report") — `/settings?tab=providers&section=capabilities-report`; code in `lib/tools/almanack/`. API actions stay `capabilities-report-*` |

Old UI routes (`/foundry/*`, `/chats`, `/characters`, `/projects`) redirect to their current equivalents.

### Character fields (by vantage point)

Four vantage-point fields plus a foundational one (`manifesto`). **Not interchangeable — never collapse them.** The character optimizer enforces these.

- **manifesto** — axiomatic core; the load-bearing truths every other field stays consistent with. Not a vantage point. Short, declarative. Synced as `manifesto.md` in the vault (case-insensitive lookup).
- **identity** — surface knowledge from outside: name, station, occupation, public reputation. Never internal motivation.
- **description** — what an interlocutor perceives: behaviour, mannerisms, verbal patterns. **NOT** physical appearance (that's `physicalDescriptions`) and not internal monologue.
- **personality** — what the character knows about themselves; the internal driver. Unseen by others unless shared.
- **title** — the user's/character's own private framing (e.g. "the rival"). Not how others refer to them; out of optimizer scope.

**Grammatical person follows the referent:** second person when the referent is the speaking character (`manifesto`, `personality`, system prompts, project/group `instructions` — all delivered inside the character's own prompt), third person when the referent is anyone else or the consumer is not a chat model (`identity`/`description` — read only by *others*; `physicalDescription` — noun phrases, shared with the image pipelines). Prompt-facing wrappers in `buildIdentityStack` fix the referent for author text; hint copy is single-sourced in `lib/services/character-field-semantics.ts` (server) and `components/prompt-fields/field-hints.ts` (client) — change them together. Any edit that changes `buildIdentityStack`'s output must bump `IDENTITY_STACK_BUILDER_VERSION` (same file) and register a golden; CI enforces both directions. Full design: `docs/developer/features/complete/prompt-person-consistency.md`.

### Personified-feature avatars

When a personified feature "speaks" via a synthetic message, its avatar lives at `public/images/avatars/<feature>-avatar.webp` (lowercase, hyphenated; e.g. `lantern-avatar.webp`). Referenced as `/images/avatars/<feature>-avatar.webp`; the `systemSender` → avatar/title table is `STAFF_AVATARS` / `STAFF_TITLES` in `lib/chat/staff-display-names.ts` (looked up by `staffAvatar(sender)` from `getMessageAvatar` in `app/salon/[id]/SalonView.tsx`).

- **Always WebP.** Convert with `cwebp -q 82 -m 6 -mt in.png -o out.webp`, then delete the PNG — every byte ships with the app.
- **Adding a sender** means updating the `systemSender` Zod enum in `lib/schemas/chat.types.ts` **and** the matching `chat_messages` SQLite column, adding a row to `STAFF_AVATARS` (and `STAFF_TITLES` if the sender has an epithet) in `lib/chat/staff-display-names.ts`, and adding the value to `public/schemas/qtap-export.schema.json`.
- **The authoritative `systemSender` list is the enum in `lib/schemas/chat.types.ts`** — read it there rather than trusting a copy here. Per-sender responsibilities: `lantern` (image pipeline), `aurora` (avatar/wardrobe), `librarian` (Document-Mode + `doc_*`), `concierge` (dangerous-content), `host` (participation + autonomous-room), `prospero` (tool-use / connection-profile / Run-Tool bubbles; `private:true` runs hide via `targetParticipantIds`), `commonplaceBook` (memory-recall whispers, targeted), `ariel` (terminal PTY open/close), `carina` (renders with the **answerer's own** avatar — no `carina-avatar.webp`), `suparna` (Suparṇā's Post Office mail-delivery announcements — new letters in a character's vault `Mail/` folder), `pascal` (Pascal the Croupier's custom-tool (pseudo-tool) roll outcomes; the roll record lives in `pascalMeta`, posted server-side so a model cannot fudge a failure into a success).

## Instances and the CLI

An **instance** is a self-contained base directory you point Quilltap at, holding `data/`, `files/`, and `logs/` subdirectories. OS defaults: macOS `~/Library/Application Support/Quilltap/`, Linux `~/.quilltap/`, Windows `%APPDATA%\Quilltap\`, Docker `/app/quilltap/`. Override with `QUILLTAP_DATA_DIR`, `--data-dir`/`-d`, `--instance <name>`, or a Docker volume mount.

> When I say I'm "in the `~/iCloud/Quilltap/Friday` instance," the troubleshooting paths are `~/iCloud/Quilltap/Friday/{data,files,logs}/`. Logs there include `combined.log` / `error.log` (auto-rolled every 2–3 MB) plus `quilltap-{stdout,stderr}.log`, `startup.log`, and sometimes `stdout.log`.

**Databases are SQLCipher-encrypted — the `sqlite3` binary can't open them. Use `npx quilltap`.** Prefer high-level subcommands over raw SQL; they auto-pick the database, resolve names to UUIDs, and are read-only unless you pass `--write`. **Full command reference: [CLI.md](docs/developer/CLI.md).** Database schema: [DDL.md](docs/developer/DDL.md).

## Themes

- **Bundle format (`.qtap-theme`)** is primary: declarative zip archives (JSON tokens, CSS, fonts, images), no build tools. **Plugin (npm) format is deprecated** — existing ones still work; new themes use bundles. `create-quilltap-theme` defaults to bundles (`--plugin` for legacy npm format).
- 6 bundled themes (Art Deco, Earl Grey, Great Estate, Madman's Box, Old School, Rains) ship as bundle dirs in `themes/bundled/`. Installed bundles live at `<dataDir>/themes/<themeId>/` (index `themes-index.json`). Registries support remote browse/install with Ed25519 verification.
- **Architecture:** registry singleton `lib/themes/theme-registry.ts` (sources `default`/`plugin`/`bundle`); loader `lib/themes/bundle-loader.ts`; registry client `lib/themes/registry-client.ts`; crypto `lib/themes/crypto.ts`; manifest schema `QtapThemeManifestSchema` (`lib/themes/types.ts`) / JSON Schema `public/schemas/qtap-theme.schema.json`; asset/font routes under `app/api/themes/`. CLI: `npx quilltap themes`.
- **`qt-*` semantic classes:** themes depend primarily on these. If you'd add a new Tailwind class, add it to a `qt-*` utility instead, then apply that.
- **A `qt-*` class that resolves to nothing is invisible to every check but a human eye**, so `npm run lint` runs `scripts/check-qt-classes.mjs` as a third gate (after ESLint and the spelling sweep). It fails on an undefined utility in the `qt-bg-`/`qt-text-`/`qt-border-`/`qt-shadow-` families, and on any `qt-*` token carrying a variant prefix: Tailwind generates variants only for utilities it knows about, and anything inside `@layer utilities` is invisible to it, so `hover:qt-bg-muted` is an undefined class name, not "`qt-bg-muted`, on hover." Write every state form out by hand, escaped, in [`app/styles/qt-components/_utilities.css`](/app/styles/qt-components/_utilities.css). Bare component classes (`qt-card`) are deliberately out of scope — many exist only as theme hooks. `lint:fix` does **not** run this gate.
- **Mirroring `qt-*` into theme-storybook is not optional.** *Every* `qt-*` change — new class, new rule, or a fix to an existing one — must be mirrored into [`packages/theme-storybook/src/css/qt-components.css`](/packages/theme-storybook/src/css/qt-components.css) in the same change, de-Tailwinded to plain CSS (that file uses no `@apply`). Mirror the app **faithfully**, including quirks; if the app rule is itself wrong, fix both or neither — never let them diverge. If the class family isn't in the storybook yet, port the whole family, not just your one rule. Then bump the package's patch version and **stop and ask the human to `npm publish` — the publish gates the commit.** (`dist/` is gitignored; `npm run build` in the package keeps the local copy current.) Also consider the stylebook, [create-quilltap-theme](/packages/create-quilltap-theme), and the bundled themes.

## Subsystem pointers

### Background jobs (summary)

All job handlers run in a lazily-forked child process. **The parent (Next.js HTTP) is the only DB writer;** the child reads via a readonly SQLCipher connection, buffers write payloads in an `AsyncLocalStorage`, and ships them over IPC. The parent partitions writes by target DB (main / mount-index / llm-logs) and commits each in its own transaction, so one partition's failure can't roll back others. **In a handler, treat `getRepositories()` as a proxy: reads pass through, writes buffer — never assume read-your-writes within a single job.** Full mechanics (main-primary autonomous turns, folder-conflict id remapping, the two `AsyncLocalStorage` contexts): [BACKGROUND_JOBS_CHILD.md](docs/developer/BACKGROUND_JOBS_CHILD.md).

### Carina (summary)

Inline LLM queries: users/characters address a designated answerer character via `@Name:` (public), `@Name?` (whisper), or the `ask_carina` tool. The answerer builds a fresh minimal call, the result posts as a `systemSender: 'carina'` message rendered with the **answerer's own avatar**, and the answer is surfaced live via a `carinaAnswer` SSE event. Carina answers are kept out of the normal per-turn memory extractor but **do** form memories and receive recall through dedicated paths (`CARINA_MEMORY_EXTRACTION` job; recall injected by `runCarinaQuery`). Failed-query errors are authored by Prospero (`systemKind: 'carina-error'`), not Carina. Full design: [features/carina.md](docs/developer/features/carina.md).

## Writing migrations

Every migration in `migrations/scripts/` (listed in `index.ts`) must satisfy two rules so the startup loading screen can describe it:

1. **A pretty-label entry in [`lib/startup/prettify.ts`](./lib/startup/prettify.ts)** (`PRETTY_LABELS`), in the steampunk-Wodehouse voice — terse, present-continuous, about the user's data, not the implementation. Without it the screen leaks the internal migration ID.
2. **Any loop over a collection calls `reportProgress(...)`** from [`migrations/lib/progress.ts`](./migrations/lib/progress.ts) (throttled to ~250 ms, safe every iteration):

   ```ts
   import { reportProgress } from '../lib/progress';
   reportProgress(i + 1, items.length, 'items');                              // flat
   reportProgress([{ current: p + 1, total: projects.length, unit: 'projects' },
                   { current: f + 1, total: files.length, unit: 'files' }]);   // nested (outer first)
   ```

   For batched/streaming migrations, count totals upfront with `SELECT COUNT(*)` and pass the running `totalScanned`. Synchronous `db.transaction(...)` can't reach the UI mid-transaction — skipping there is fine.

The commit skill enforces both rules and will block a non-compliant migration.
