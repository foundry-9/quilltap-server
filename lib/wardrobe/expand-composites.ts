/**
 * Composite Wardrobe Item Expansion
 *
 * Wardrobe items can reference other items via `componentItemIds`, building
 * up layered or themed outfits ("nice jewelry" = locket + earrings + ring;
 * "rain outfit" = raincoat + jeans + boots). Wearing one dissolves it into
 * its leaves (`slot-ops.ts`); expansion here is the shared walk behind that,
 * behind read-time resolution, and behind a legacy composite id still sitting
 * in equipped state.
 *
 * Expansion is cycle-tolerant — vault files are user-editable, and a malformed
 * cycle must never break a chat. Cycles are logged and the offending branch
 * is truncated. Save-time validation (`detectComponentCycles`) is the place
 * to reject cycles before they land.
 *
 * Pure and client-safe: no logger. Cycles and depth truncation come back in
 * the result for the caller to log.
