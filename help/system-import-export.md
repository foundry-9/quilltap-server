# Import & Export Data

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=system&section=import-export)**

The Import & Export tool lets you save your Quilltap data to files and load data from files back into your system.

## Export: Saving Your Data

Export lets you save characters, chats, memories, and templates to files in Quilltap format.

**What can you export:**

- Characters and their configurations
- Chat histories and messages
- Associated memories
- Roleplay templates
- All metadata

**Why export:**

- Share characters or chats with others
- Back up specific data (not a full system backup)
- Migrate to another Quilltap instance
- Create archives of completed projects
- Share setups with other users

### How to Export

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to the **AI Providers** tab in Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Find the Import / Export card**

3. **Click "Export Data"** button

4. **Select what to export:**
   - Choose which characters, chats, or templates to include
   - Check/uncheck items you want included

5. **Choose export options:**
   - **Include Memories:** Whether to include associated memories
   - Shows how many memories will be included

6. **Review your selection**
   - Verify the items you're exporting
   - Confirm memory inclusion setting

7. **Click "Export"**
   - System creates the export file
   - May take several minutes for large exports

8. **Download the file**
   - A `.quilltap` file downloads to your computer
   - Store it in a safe location
   - Share it if needed

**Export file contains:**

- All selected data in Quilltap format
- Metadata about characters, chats, memories
- Images and media (if included)
- Complete chat histories
- Memory data

## Import: Loading Data

Import lets you load exported data from `.quilltap` files back into your system.

**What can you import:**

- Exported characters
- Exported chats
- Associated memories
- Templates and settings

**Why import:**

- Restore from an export file
- Use characters/chats shared by others
- Migrate from another instance
- Add previously exported data back

### How to Import

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Go to the **AI Providers** tab in Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Find the Import / Export card**

3. **Click "Import Data"** button

4. **Select import file**
   - Click to choose a `.quilltap` file from your computer
   - Or drag and drop the file
   - System reads the file and previews contents

5. **Review what will be imported**
   - List of characters, chats, memories to import
   - Count of each entity type
   - File sizes and metadata

6. **Choose conflict resolution strategy:**
   - **Keep Existing:** Don't overwrite if item already exists
   - **Replace:** Overwrite existing items with imported versions
   - **Create New:** Always create new items (rename if necessary)

7. **Choose memory handling:**
   - **Include Memories:** Import associated memories if included in export
   - **Skip Memories:** Don't import memories (import only items)

8. **Select which items to import**
   - You can deselect specific characters, chats, or templates
   - Only checked items will be imported

9. **Review your choices** and click "Import"

10. **Wait for import to complete**
    - System processes the import
    - May take several minutes
    - Creates new items in your system

11. **Import complete**
    - Success message shows what was imported
    - New items appear in your system
    - Memories may be queued for processing

### Understanding Conflict Resolution

**Keep Existing (Recommended for merging):**

- If you already have a character named "Alice", the import is skipped
- Use this to add new items without overwriting
- Safe option that won't lose existing work

**Replace (Recommended for updating):**

- If you already have a character named "Alice", it's overwritten with the imported version
- Use this to update items with newer versions
- Replaces completely, no merging

**Create New (Recommended for duplicating):**

- Creates a copy even if item exists
- Imported character becomes "Alice 2" if "Alice" exists
- Useful for having multiple versions

## Understanding Import Results

After import completes, you see:

**Summary of what was imported:**

- Number of characters created
- Number of chats created
- Number of templates created
- Number of memories queued (if included)

**Next steps:**

- New items appear in your system immediately
- Memories may take time to process
- You can review imported items

## Exporting from Chats

You can also export individual chats directly from within a chat:

1. **Open a chat**
2. **Look for export option** (usually in chat menu)
3. **Click "Export Chat"**
4. **Choose export options**
5. **Chat is exported** to a file

This creates a quick export of just that chat.

## Relationship Preservation

When you import data, Quilltap automatically preserves and updates relationships between entities:

**Character relationships:**

- Default connection profile (for LLM selection)
- Default image profile (for image generation)
- Default roleplay template (for conversation style)
- Default partner character (for paired conversations)
- Tags assigned to the character

**Chat relationships:**

- All participant characters
- Each participant's connection and image profiles
- Each participant's roleplay template
- Project association
- Tags assigned to the chat

**Memory relationships:**

- Associated character
- Associated chat
- Associated project
- Tags assigned to the memory

**Profile relationships:**

- Tags assigned to connection, image, and embedding profiles

**Template relationships:**

- Tags assigned to roleplay templates

When using the "Create New" conflict strategy, all internal references are automatically updated to point to the newly created copies.

## Import/Export File Format

**File format:** `.qtap` — streaming newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON).

**Structure:**

- First line is an envelope carrying the manifest (`{"format":"qtap-ndjson","version":1,"manifest":{...}}`)
- Each subsequent line is a single tagged record — one character, one memory, one message, and so on — so nothing in the pipeline has to hold the whole export in memory at once
- Large binary blobs (document-store attachments) are split across multiple chunk lines and stitched back together on import
- A trailing footer line carries authoritative record counts
- Relationships stored as references that are remapped on import
- Because every line is independently valid JSON, a `.qtap` file can be browsed or grepped with any text tool

**Compatibility:**

- Version 4.3+ writes the streaming NDJSON format. Older versions wrote a single monolithic JSON object; those files still import just fine, though exports above ~450 MB that were produced by those older versions cannot be read — re-export them from a current Quilltap build first
- Export files are version-tagged, so older clients refusing a newer file is the expected behavior
- Contact support if import fails

## Troubleshooting

**Export failed**

- Check that you selected at least one item
- Ensure sufficient disk space for the download
- As of version 4.3 the export streams record-by-record, so even characters with tens of thousands of memories export cleanly — if a modern export still fails, check the server log for a specific error
- Contact support if issue persists

**Import failed**

- Verify file is a valid `.qtap` file (either streaming NDJSON or a legacy monolithic JSON export)
- Check that file hasn't been corrupted (a truncated NDJSON file will report a specific line number)
- Very old exports above ~450 MB that used the monolithic JSON format are too large to import on modern runtimes — re-export them from a newer Quilltap build first
- Try changing conflict resolution strategy
- Contact support if error persists

**Import very slow**

- Large imports take time (importing 1000+ messages can be slow)
- Don't close browser tab during import
- Check Tasks Queue to see import progress

**Memories didn't import**

- Memories import as separate queue items
- Check Tasks Queue to see memory processing jobs
- Memories may take time to process
- Check if "Include Memories" was selected during import

**Duplicate items created**

- If using "Create New" strategy, duplicates are expected
- To avoid duplicates, use "Replace" or "Keep Existing"
- Delete duplicates manually if not wanted

## Best Practices

**For Sharing:**

- Export specific characters or chats
- Test import in test instance before sharing
- Document any customizations in export

**For Backups:**

- Export regularly alongside full backups
- Export by feature/topic for organization
- Store exports with descriptive names

**For Migration:**

- Export all data from old instance
- Import into new instance
- Verify all items imported successfully
- Compare item counts

**For Collaboration:**

- Share specific exports with team members
- Use "Keep Existing" when importing collaborative exports
- Coordinate who owns which items
