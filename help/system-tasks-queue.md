# Managing Tasks

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/tools)**

The Tasks Queue shows all background jobs running in your Quilltap system. These include memory extraction, imports, exports, and other long-running operations.

## Understanding the Tasks Queue

**What are background tasks:**

- Operations that run in the background without blocking the UI
- Memory extraction from chat messages
- Import and export operations
- File processing
- System analysis jobs
- Anything that takes significant time

**Why they run in background:**

- Allows you to keep using Quilltap while tasks run
- Prevents UI freezing
- Processes data efficiently

## Viewing the Tasks Queue

**Go to Tools page** (`/tools`) and look for the **Tasks Queue** card.

The Tasks Queue displays:

**Active Jobs:**

- Jobs currently running
- Current progress (percentage or count)
- Estimated time remaining
- Resource usage (memory, CPU)

**Queued Jobs:**

- Jobs waiting to run
- Estimated start time
- Priority level

**Completed Jobs:**

- Recent completed jobs
- Success/failure status
- Completion time

**Failed Jobs:**

- Jobs that encountered errors
- Error messages
- Retry options

## Task Types

**Memory Extraction**

- Processes chat messages to extract important memories
- Triggered manually or during import
- Shows progress (e.g., "Processing 50/200 messages")

**Import Operations**

- Running import from export file
- Shows how many items have been imported
- Progress includes character, chat, and memory counts

**Export Operations**

- Creating export files
- Shows progress of data collection
- Completes with download link

**Analysis Jobs**

- System analysis and optimization
- Memory cleanup
- Database maintenance

**Backup/Restore**

- Full system backup creation
- Restore from backup operations
- Shows percentage complete

## Monitoring Tasks

### Task Details

Click on a task to see more information:

- **Task ID** - Unique identifier
- **Type** - What kind of job it is
- **Status** - Running, queued, completed, failed
- **Progress** - Percentage or items processed
- **Started At** - When task began
- **Estimated Time** - How long until completion
- **Resources** - Memory and CPU usage

### Task Status

**Running (Blue/Active)**

- Task is currently processing
- Progress continues in real time
- Can usually be paused

**Queued (Gray)**

- Task waiting to run
- Will start when resources available
- Can be reordered or cancelled

**Completed (Green)**

- Task finished successfully
- Results available
- Can be viewed or downloaded

**Failed (Red)**

- Task encountered error
- Error details shown
- May be retryable

**Paused (Yellow)**

- Task temporarily stopped
- Can be resumed
- Progress saved

## Controlling Tasks

### Pause a Task

**To pause a running task:**

1. Find the task in the queue
2. Click the **Pause** button
3. Task pauses and can be resumed later
4. Progress is saved

**Why pause tasks:**

- Free up system resources
- Temporarily stop a task
- Pause during peak usage times

### Resume a Task

**To resume a paused task:**

1. Find the paused task in the queue
2. Click the **Resume** button
3. Task continues from where it paused
4. Progress resumes

### Cancel a Task

**To cancel a task:**

1. Find the task in the queue
2. Click the **Cancel** or **Delete** button
3. Confirm cancellation
4. Task is removed from queue

**What happens when cancelled:**

- For running tasks: Processing stops
- For queued tasks: Removed from queue
- Any partial results are discarded
- Task won't resume

**When to cancel:**

- Task is taking too long
- Task appears stuck
- You changed your mind about the operation
- High priority task needs to run

### Retry a Failed Task

**To retry a failed task:**

1. Find the failed task (marked in red)
2. Click **Retry** button
3. Task is re-queued to run again
4. May have different result this time

**When to retry:**

- Temporary network failure
- Resource temporarily unavailable
- After system configuration change

## Understanding Task Resources

**The Tasks Queue shows:**

**Memory Usage**

- RAM being used by the task
- If too high, system may slow down
- Excessive memory may indicate problem

**CPU Usage**

- Processing power being used
- 0-100% scale
- High usage = resource intensive task

**Estimated Time**

- Based on current speed and remaining work
- May be inaccurate for first tasks
- Updates as task progresses

## Managing System Load

**When system is overloaded:**

- Pause non-critical tasks
- Cancel low-priority tasks
- Let high-priority tasks complete
- Restart system if needed

**Task priority levels (if shown):**

- **High:** Imports, critical operations
- **Normal:** Most memory extraction
- **Low:** Cleanup, analysis tasks

**To reduce system load:**

1. Check Tasks Queue
2. Pause background music or other apps
3. Cancel non-urgent tasks
4. Give system time to catch up

## Common Task Scenarios

**Import taking too long:**

- Large imports take time (normal)
- Don't cancel unless stuck
- Check if system resources are available
- Consider splitting large imports

**Memory extraction seems slow:**

- Processing hundreds of messages takes time
- Rate depends on provider and system
- Can pause to free up resources
- Won't affect chat functionality

**Multiple tasks running:**

- System queues tasks and processes them
- Tasks run serially or in parallel depending on resources
- Restarting can help clear stuck tasks

**Task disappeared:**

- May have completed and been archived
- Check "Completed Jobs" section
- Some tasks clear after finishing

## Troubleshooting

**Task is stuck**

- Check if system has resources available
- Try pausing and resuming
- Cancel task and retry
- Restart system if necessary

**Task failed with error**

- Read error message carefully
- Common causes: network issues, insufficient space, permissions
- Retry task if error was temporary
- Contact support if error persists

**Can't see my tasks**

- Refresh the page
- Task may have completed and been cleared
- Check completed/failed sections
- Very old tasks may be archived

**Tasks queue won't process**

- Ensure background processor is running
- Check system health
- Try restarting
- Contact support if queue remains stuck

## Best Practices

**Monitor Important Tasks:**

- Check queue when importing large data
- Watch memory extraction after import
- Verify critical operations complete

**Avoid Overloading:**

- Don't queue too many tasks at once
- Let imports complete before starting others
- Monitor system resources

**Use Pause Strategically:**

- Pause non-critical tasks during peak times
- Resume when less busy
- Keeps important work flowing

**Regular Cleanup:**

- Clear very old completed tasks
- Archive results
- Remove failed tasks after retrying
