/**
 * Second-generation restore de-dup (Bug 12).
 *
 * A backup taken from an instance that was itself restored already carries the
 * doc-store rows (file / link / blob) for its project-less user files: each
 * such file's `storageKey` is a `mount-blob:` key pointing at a blob the
 * archive will restore verbatim (phases 22c–22f), and its link already sits at
 * `restored/<name>`. If the restore's file replay re-ingests those files, it
 * mints a *fresh* blob + link at that same path and gets there first, so the
 * archived link then collides on `UNIQUE(mountPointId, relativePath)` and loses
 * its id — one more duplicated store row per restore generation.
 *
 * This helper lets the replay recognise the carried rows and skip re-ingesting,
 * so the archived rows restore intact. It is deliberately a small, pure check
 * (the fix the v4 notes deferred, ported without any phase reorder).
 *
 * It applies to project-bound files as well (bug 185): a project restored
 * bound to its archived official store would otherwise take a replayed link in
 * that very store, colliding with the archived link the restore writes later.
 *
