/**
 * Character archive: pack a character into a `.qtap` bundle, commit a
 * tombstone, and **prune the vault in place** (§4.2a of the archive spec).
 *
 * Operator-only — no tool, no job, no sweep.
 *
 * Archiving does NOT delete the character's vault. It keeps the ten
 * managed-field documents, the avatar blob(s) and their link rows, and the
 * wardrobe — so a tombstone is still a readable character page and every id
 * old chats reference keeps resolving — and moves everything heavy (photos,
 * `Mail/`, conversation summaries, the character's own memories, and the
 * chunks of everything deleted) into the bundle before deleting it.
 *
 * **Ordering is chosen for crash-safety**, because the main DB and the mount
 * index cannot share a transaction:
 *
 * 1. Write the bundle to an ARCHIVE `files` row, encrypted under the instance
 *    passphrase (§4.2c — never the pepper; see lib/characters/archive-crypto).
 * 2. Verify it by decrypting and reading back the ciphertext that will be
 *    persisted — a hard gate before anything is deleted.
 * 3. Commit the tombstone in one main-DB write: `archivedAt` + `archiveFileId`,
 *    null the default-* FKs, flip chat seats to absent. Deliberately NOT
 *    touched: `characterDocumentMountPointId` (the vault survives),
 *    `defaultImageId` and `avatarOverrides` (they point at blobs the prune
 *    keeps — nulling them is what took the face off old messages).
 * 4. Prune (idempotent, re-runnable): own memories, the vector store, then
 *    every vault link outside the keep-set, through the document-store delete
 *    paths so link-group orphan GC runs.
 *
 * A failure before step 3 removes the bundle it wrote and leaves the character
 * fully live. A failure during step 4 reports `pruneComplete: false`; calling
 * `archiveCharacter` again re-runs the prune only and never rewrites the
 * bundle. Because the prune is a delete-set rather than a teardown, re-running
 * it is naturally idempotent — anything already gone stays gone, and the
 * keep-set is never a candidate.
 *
 * Untouched, by design: chats, messages, annotations, group membership,
 * project rosters, and *other* characters' memories about this one.

 * the prune deleted comes back at its original ids.
 *
 * 1. Load the bundle from `archiveFileId`, decrypt it (§4.2c — a wrong
 *    passphrase reports the "predates your passphrase change" diagnosis, not a
 *    GCM failure), and verify the plaintext against the file row's recorded

 * 2. Import it with `preserveIds` in **skip-if-present** mode: an id already

 *    construction) is skipped; an id living anywhere else still refuses
 *    atomically. The import is additive and id-preserving, so a partial
 *    restore re-run skips what the first pass already put back.
 * 3. Clear `archivedAt` (the single-key patch the §4.4 guard sanctions), then
 *    — on the now-live row — `archiveFileId` and any pre-revision
 *    `archivedAvatarFileId` (whose thumbnail file row is deleted).
 * 4. Flip absent chat seats back to active, re-chunk the restored text
 *    documents, and enqueue embedding jobs. Restored memories were already
 *    enqueued by the import itself.
