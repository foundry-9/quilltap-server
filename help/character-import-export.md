### Export File Structure

When you export, the file contains:

**Quilltap format (.json):**

```json
{
  "name": "Alice",
  "title": "The Wanderer",
  "description": "...",
  "personality": "...",
  "scenarios": [
    { "title": "The Brass Lantern Tavern", "content": "..." },
    { "title": "The Road to Vienna", "content": "..." }
  ],
  "firstMessage": "...",
  "exampleDialogues": "...",
  "systemPrompt": "...",
  "avatar": "...",
  "tags": [...],
  "connectionProfile": "...",
  "imageProfile": "..."
}
```

All character data in one JSON file.

### Backing Up Your Characters

**Best practice backup workflow:**

1. **Periodic bulk export:**
   - Every month/week, export all characters
   - Save as "[Date] Character Backup.zip"
   - Store in safe location

2. **Before major changes:**
   - Export individual characters before major edits
   - Keep backup named "[Character Name] v1.json"
   - Can restore if changes don't work out

3. **Cloud backup:**
   - Download exported files
   - Upload to cloud storage (Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Ensures characters survive computer loss

## Character Import

### Where Do Imported Characters Come From

Import characters from:

- **Your own exports** — Characters you previously exported
- **Other users** — Characters friends shared with you
- **Character libraries** — Public character collections
- **SillyTavern** — Characters from SillyTavern
- **Community sources** — Characters shared online
- **Modified exports** — Your own characters modified as JSON

2. Click **Import** or **+ Import Character**
3. Select file from your computer
4. Choose what to import:
   - Create new character from file
   - Or merge with existing character
5. Review import preview
6. Click **Import** or **Confirm**
7. Character imported

**Method 2: Using Drag and Drop**

1. Open Characters page
2. Find character file on computer
3. Drag and drop onto Characters page

**SillyTavern Format**

- Generally compatible
- Most data transfers over
- Some features may not transfer
- Image handling may differ

**Other JSON Formats**

- May be partially compatible
- Import attempt may work
- May need manual adjustment after import

### Import Preview

Before finalizing import, see preview of:

- Character name
- Description
- Key attributes
- Tags
- Avatar/image

**Option to:**

- Import as-is
- Change character name during import
- Adjust settings
- Cancel import

### Handling Import Issues

**Issue: Character imports but name is weird**

1. Edit character after import
2. Change name as desired
3. Save

**Issue: Avatar/image doesn't import**

1. Character imports without image
2. Edit character
3. Upload new avatar
4. Re-save

**Issue: System prompt looks wrong**

1. Character imported with original prompt
2. Edit System Prompts tab
3. Correct or replace prompt
4. Save

**Issue: Tags don't exist in new Quilltap**

1. Import creates tags automatically
2. Tags appear if needed
3. Can reorganize after import

### Importing Multiple Characters

**Bulk Import:**

1. Have exported `.zip` file with characters
2. Go to Characters page
3. Click **Import Multiple** or drag `.zip`
4. All characters import
5. Creates any necessary tags
6. Characters now available in system

### SillyTavern Compatibility

If importing from SillyTavern:

**What imports well:**

- Character name ✓
- Description ✓
- Personality ✓
- Scenario ✓ (imported as a single scenario in the scenarios list)
- First message ✓
- Example dialogues ✓
- Avatar image ✓

**What may not transfer:**

- Custom system prompts (may need re-creation)
- External links (may break)
- Special formatting (may lose structure)

**Best practice for SillyTavern import:**

1. Import character
2. Review system prompt
3. Adjust if needed for your LLM
4. Test character in chat
5. Make any necessary adjustments

## Sharing Characters

### How to Share Exported Characters

**Send to Friend:**

1. Export character as JSON
2. Email the `.json` file to friend
3. Friend downloads file
4. Friend imports in their Quilltap

**Share on Forum/Community:**

1. Export character
2. Post `.json` file to community
3. Others download and import
4. Character shared with community

**Share as Attachment:**

1. Export character
2. Share via messaging app
3. Recipient imports when downloaded
4. Works cross-platform

### Sharing Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Include character description with file | Share without context |
| Note any special setup required | Assume others know character |
| Include version number | Keep overwriting old versions |
| Test before sharing | Share untested character |
| Note any dependencies | Assume character works standalone |

### Collaboration Workflow

**When collaborating on character:**

1. One person creates and exports character
2. Sends to collaborator
3. Collaborator imports and makes edits
4. Exports modified version
5. Original person imports updated version
6. Continue back and forth as needed

## Advanced Import/Export

### Editing Exported Characters (JSON)

If you're comfortable with JSON, you can edit directly:

1. Export character
2. Open the `.qtap` file in a text editor — it's newline-delimited JSON, one entity per line
3. Find the line whose first field is `"kind":"character"` and edit fields inside its `"data":{...}` object:

   ```json
   {"kind":"character","data":{"name":"New Name","description":"New description..."}}
   ```

4. Save file (keep the newline-per-record structure intact)
5. Re-import in Quilltap

**Caution:** JSON syntax must be valid on every line or the import will fail with a specific line number.

### Creating Characters from JSON

If you know JSON structure:

1. Create new `.json` file
2. Follow Quilltap character JSON structure
3. Fill in all required fields
4. Save as `.json`
5. Import in Quilltap

**Quilltap Character JSON Structure:**

```json
{
  "name": "Character Name",
  "title": "Character Title",
  "description": "Full description text",
  "personality": "Personality traits",
  "scenarios": [
    { "title": "Scenario Title", "content": "Setting/scenario description" }
  ],
  "firstMessage": "Opening message",
  "exampleDialogues": "Example conversations",
  "systemPrompt": "AI instructions",
  "avatar": "image or URL",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"],
  "connectionProfile": null,
  "imageProfile": null
}
```

Note that `scenarios` is an array of objects with `title` and `content` fields. A character may have zero, one, or many scenarios. The SillyTavern format uses a single `"scenario"` string field, which Quilltap imports as a single entry in the scenarios list.

### Batch Import/Export with Scripts

For power users with technical knowledge:

1. Character files can be processed with scripts
2. Automate batch operations
3. Transfer characters between systems
4. Requires command-line knowledge

**Not covered in this guide** — See technical documentation if needed.

## Cloud Backup Strategy

### Using Cloud Storage

**Setup:**

1. Export all characters regularly
2. Save exports to computer
3. Upload to cloud storage (Google Drive, Dropbox, iCloud)
4. Automatic sync ensures backup

**Recovery:**

1. If needed, download from cloud storage
2. Import characters back into Quilltap
3. Restore full collection

**Benefits:**

- Automatic backup
- Access from multiple devices
- Safe offsite storage
- Easy to share backups

### Backup Naming Convention

Use clear naming for backups:

```
Character Backups/
├── 2024-01-15 Full Backup.zip
├── 2024-02-01 Full Backup.zip
├── Alice v1.json (original)
├── Alice v2.json (revised)
└── Alice v3.json (final)
```

This makes it easy to:

- Find backups by date
- Track character versions
- Restore specific versions

## Troubleshooting Import/Export

### Problem: Export File Won't Download

**Solution:**

1. Check browser settings
2. Allow downloads
3. Check download location
4. Try again
5. Try different format

### Problem: Import Says File is Invalid

**Solution:**

1. Ensure file is `.json` or `.json.png`
2. Check file isn't corrupted
3. Try exporting fresh character
4. Try importing to test

### Problem: Character Imports But Data is Wrong

**Solution:**

1. Check original character
2. If export was wrong, re-export
3. Manually edit character after import
4. Test character

### Problem: SillyTavern Character Won't Import

**Solution:**

1. Ensure file is valid SillyTavern format
2. Try re-export from SillyTavern
3. Import may partially work — fix manually after
4. Contact support with specific format issue

### Problem: Bulk Import Creates Duplicates

**Solution:**

1. Check if characters already exist
2. If accidental duplicates, delete extras
3. Be careful importing same file twice
4. Always check before bulk import
