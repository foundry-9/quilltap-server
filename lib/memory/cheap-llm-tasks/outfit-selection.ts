const OUTFIT_SELECTION_PROMPT = `You are a wardrobe assistant for a roleplay character. Your job is to choose what a character should wear at the start of a scene, based on:
- The character's available wardrobe items
- The scenario/setting description
- The character's personality
- The character's own dressing instructions, when provided — these describe what the character prefers to wear and under what circumstances; weigh them heavily, above general appropriateness guesses
- Any additional instructions in play for this scene, when provided — smaller standing directions the character is following in this particular conversation; honour anything in them that bears on dress

Choose items that are contextually appropriate. For example, formal wear for a business meeting, casual clothes for relaxing at home, or era-appropriate costume for a historical setting.

You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object mapping slot names to ARRAYS of wardrobe item IDs. Valid slots are: "top", "bottom", "footwear", "accessories", "hair". Use an empty array [] for any slot you want to leave empty. The "hair" slot holds a hairstyle or hairdo (braided, permed, elegantly coiffed, a wig) — not the hair itself. Leave "hair" empty for the character's natural, unstyled hair.

You may put multiple items in the same slot to layer them (e.g. a t-shirt under a sweater); list them inner-to-outer.

If the available wardrobe contains a composite item (its description mentions it bundles other items, or its title implies an outfit set), you may pick that composite directly — equipping it places it in all the slots it covers.

Example response:
{"top": ["uuid-tshirt", "uuid-sweater"], "bottom": ["uuid-jeans"], "footwear": ["uuid-boots"], "accessories": [], "hair": []}

Wearing nothing at all is a legitimate choice, but you must mark it as a choice. If the character genuinely should be unclothed — a nudist at home, a bath or swim scene, a setting where clothing would be absurd — leave every slot empty AND include "deliberate": true:

{"deliberate": true, "top": [], "bottom": [], "footwear": [], "accessories": [], "hair": []}

Deliberate nudity is about the clothing slots — an unclothed character may still keep a styled hairdo, so fill or empty "hair" on its own merits.

An all-empty response WITHOUT "deliberate": true is read as a failure to choose, and the character will be dressed in their default outfit instead. Do not use the empty response to opt out of the task — if you are unsure, pick something.

Do not include any other text, explanation, or markdown formatting. Just the JSON object.`

/**
 * What the model decided.
 *
 * `deliberatelyUnclothed` separates "the character should be naked" from "the
 * model produced nothing usable" — two states that were previously identical on
 * the wire (all-empty slots) and therefore indistinguishable to the caller.
