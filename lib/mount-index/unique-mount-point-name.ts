/**
 * Mount-point name uniquification — pure string logic, client-safe.
 *
 * Single source of truth for the "append ` (2)`, ` (3)`, … until unique"
 * naming policy used when provisioning document stores. Shared by:
 *   - runtime auto-creation (`ensure-project-store.ts`, `ensure-group-store.ts`,
 *     via `ensure-official-store.ts`);
 *   - the one-time cutover migration (`cutover-projects-to-store.ts`);
 *   - the legacy file-conversion migration
 *     (`convert-project-files-to-document-stores.ts`).
 *
 * Keeping the policy here guarantees runtime and migrations agree on naming.
 * This module imports nothing node-only, so it stays importable from any
 * context (the callers supply the set of taken names from their own DB access).
 *
 * @module mount-index/unique-mount-point-name

 *
 * Numbering starts at `(2)` (there is no `(1)`); the suffix is ` (N)` with a
 * single leading space and parentheses around the number.
 *
 * @param takenNames Set of mount-point names already in use.
