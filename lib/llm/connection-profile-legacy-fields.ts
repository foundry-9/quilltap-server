/**
 * Seeding the connection-profile columns an *older* archive cannot carry.
 *
 * Backup/restore and `.qtap` import are both schema-driven: an entity is
 * re-inserted by spreading whatever the archive held, so a column added to the
 * Zod schema rides along for free. That is only true for a column the archive
 * actually *has*. A key absent from the archive is absent from the INSERT, and
 * SQLite then applies the table DEFAULT — which is the right answer for a
 * brand-new row and the wrong one for a profile whose owner made a choice
 * before the column existed.
 *
 * Two columns on `connection_profiles` are in that position, both of them
 * decided by a migration on the upgrade path and by nothing at all on the
 * restore/import path:
 *
 * - **`supportsImageUpload`** (4.3+) — `DEFAULT 0`. Restoring a pre-4.3 archive
 *   stripped image upload from every profile that had it. Seeded here from the
 *   historic per-provider capability map, which is what
 *   `add-profile-supports-image-upload-field-v1` did to the same rows in place.
 * - **`multiCharacterPrefill`** (4.9+) — `DEFAULT 1`. Restoring a pre-4.9
 *   archive turned the `[Name]` assistant prefill ON, including for Anthropic
 *   profiles, where 4.6+ rejects an assistant tail outright and every
 *   multi-character turn then fails. Seeded here as an explicit `null` — the
 *   documented "never chosen" state — so `profileUsesNamePrefill()` resolves
 *   the provider default instead of a table default nobody picked.
 *
 * The 4.10 fallback-chain columns — **`fallbackProfileId`** and
 * **`allowTierFallback`** — are named here too, but for a different reason.
 * Their table DEFAULTs (NULL and 0) *are* the neutral answer: a profile from
 * an archive that predates them simply has no understudy, which is exactly
 * how it behaved before the columns existed. What they need instead is a
 * sanity check, because `fallbackProfileId` is the module's first column
 * holding a *reference*: a hand-edited bundle can name the profile itself,
 * and a self-referential chain is the one shape config validation forbids.
 *
 * Both restore and import call this, so the two paths cannot drift: a `.qtap`
 * bundle and a backup ZIP carrying the same profile land the same row.
 *
