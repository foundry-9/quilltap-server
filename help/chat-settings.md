# Chat Settings

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=chat)**

Chat Settings control global behavior for all your chats in Quilltap, including how conversations look, how they're stored, and which services are used for special features.

## Accessing Chat Settings

1. Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
2. Click the **Chat Settings** tab
3. You'll see multiple setting cards for different aspects of chat behavior

## Global vs. Per-Chat

The Chat Settings page is where you set *defaults* — the standing instructions that apply to every chat unless one of them politely asks to do otherwise. The per-chat overrides (Image Provider, Announce Generated Images, Auto-generate Avatars, Roleplay Template, Project, Agent Mode, and the like) used to live in a Chat Settings modal, but now hold court in the **Chat** drawer of the right-hand **Chat Sidebar** inside any open conversation. See [Chat Sidebar](chat-participants.md) for the full tour of that cabinet.

## Understanding Chat Settings Sections

### Composition Mode

Decides whether each new chat is delivered to your blotter pre-poised for prose. When the toggle is enabled, every fresh chat opens in composition mode — Enter inserts a newline, and Ctrl/Cmd+Enter sends the message — which suits leisurely paragraphs, formatted scenes, and other unhurried correspondence. When disabled (the factory default), new chats open in chat mode, where Enter sends and Shift+Enter inserts a newline, in the brisk fashion of a telegram clerk.

**Setting Options:**

- **Start New Chats in Composition Mode** — A simple boolean. On: new chats begin in composition mode. Off: new chats begin in chat mode.

**How to configure:**

1. Tick or untick the box at the top of the Chat tab in Settings
2. The change applies to chats created after the toggle, not to existing ones
3. The composer's toolbar still lets you flip the mode for any individual chat at any time

**When useful:**

- You favor multi-paragraph messages and would rather not bump Shift each time
- You're using Quilltap chiefly for long-form roleplay or co-writing rather than rapid-fire chat

### Composer

A small but civilising amenity: red-pencil underlines beneath any word the dictionary fails to recognise, kept switched on by default for the saving of one's dignity. The toggle governs both the Salon composer (where one's daily correspondence is conducted) and the Document Mode rich editor (where longer compositions are mustered into shape). It does **not** disturb the raw-Markdown or plain-text source views, which are left blissfully unsquiggled so that one's punctuation and tagging are not mistaken for misspellings.

In the Quilltap desktop application — that more dignified vessel than the bare browser — a right-click upon any flagged word produces a small menu of suggestions in the manner of an attentive sub-editor, together with the option to add the offending coinage to your personal dictionary. The browser, alas, offers no such courtesy.

When running inside the desktop application, Quilltap also discreetly feeds the names of all characters in your Aurora into the spellchecker's custom dictionary, so that the invented appellations of your cast (Aristarchus, Theophilus, Penwallow, &c.) do not appear unjustly accused. New characters are added on the next reload; deletions remove them in turn.

**Setting Options:**

- **Spellcheck in the composer** — A single toggle. On: red squiggles appear beneath misspelled words in the rich-text composer and the Document Mode editor. Off: silence prevails.

**How to configure:**

1. Open the **Composer** card on the Chat tab in Settings
2. Tick or untick the box
3. The change applies at once to all open composers; no reload required

**When useful:**

- You suffer the occasional typographical lapse and would rather be told than not
- You are drafting fiction in Document Mode and want a steady second pair of eyes
- (Desktop only) You have a cast of invented names and would rather not see them all flagged as misspellings

**When to turn it off:**

- The squiggles distract you in flow
- You are writing in a language Chromium does not recognise (you may also configure additional languages in the desktop app's developer console — a refinement we will dress up in a proper picker in a later issue)

### Auto-Scroll

A question of etiquette: when a character at last lays down the pen at the close of a long reply, should the page hurry you down to the final flourish, or leave you precisely where you were reading? This toggle decides.

Left unchecked — and the factory leaves it so — the Salon is a patient host. As a reply streams in and a new message takes its place in the conversation, the page holds its station; a windy three-page soliloquy can no longer spirit your place off the bottom of the screen mid-sentence. Whenever you have wandered up the page to revisit earlier remarks, a discreet **jump to latest** button presents itself in the lower corner, ready to whisk you back down at a single tap.

Switch it on, and the Salon resumes the eager old manners: each time a reply concludes (or a fresh message arrives), it glides to the newest line — but only when you were already loitering near the bottom. Should you have scrolled up to read, it has the courtesy to stay put regardless.

Two courtesies are constant in either mode: dispatching a message of your own settles you at the foot of the conversation, and first opening a chat deposits you at its end.

**Setting Options:**

- **Chase each reply to its end** — A single toggle. On: the Salon scrolls to the newest message when a reply completes, provided you were near the bottom. Off (default): the page stays where you left it, and a *jump to latest* button appears when you're scrolled up.

**How to configure:**

1. Open the **Auto-Scroll** card on the Chat tab in Settings
2. Tick or untick the box
3. The change applies at once to open chats; no reload required

**When useful:**

- You read replies as they stream and resent being yanked to the bottom the instant they finished — leave it off
- You prefer the conversation to always present its freshest line without lifting a finger — switch it on

### Text Replacement

A scribe's tireless apprentice for the rich-text surfaces: when you type a registered trigger word and then strike a word-boundary character (a space, a comma, a full stop, what have you), Quilltap quietly swaps the trigger for its appointed replacement. `teh` becomes `the`; `Aris` blossoms into `Aristarchus the Wise`; `omw` rises into `on my way`. The transformation is wrought as a single editorial gesture, so one tap of Cmd/Ctrl+Z restores the literal letters you typed (a second tap then walks back the typing itself, in the customary manner).

Replacements fire only on **typed** input — pasted prose passes through unmolested, the better to preserve what you have copied from elsewhere. Triggers are matched as whole words against the *end* of a text node, so mid-word edits are politely declined. Source-mode surfaces (the raw Markdown view, the plain-text view) are left untouched, lest a perfectly good `#heading` find itself rewritten en route.

The feature is, at present, deliberately modest: literal triggers, literal replacements, no regex, no multi-line snippets, no cursor-positioning conjuring tricks. The aim is the cross-platform substitute for OS autocorrect that the browser otherwise withholds — and to do that one task well before reaching for more.

**Setting Options:**

- **Master toggle** — *Text replacement (autocorrect)*. On: rules fire. Off: rules sit quietly while preserving the list, so you may A/B the feature without losing your work.
- **Add a rule** — A small form for the trigger, the replacement, and a per-rule **Case-sensitive** flag. When case-sensitive, only the exact casing matches (`URL` is honoured; `url` is not). When case-insensitive (the default), any casing matches and the replacement is written verbatim.
- **Rules** — The full ledger of registered replacements. Each row may be edited in place (changes save on blur or Enter), temporarily disabled with the **On** checkbox, or struck out entirely with **Delete**.
- **Try it** — A scratch textarea at the bottom of the card. Type a trigger plus a space to confirm a rule fires as intended. Nothing typed here is saved.

**How to configure:**

1. Open the **Text Replacement** card on the Chat tab in Settings
2. Tick the master toggle on (it is on by default)
3. Add rules one at a time, or edit the rows already present
4. Test in the **Try it** box, or stroll over to the Salon composer or Document Mode

**When useful:**

- Frequent typographic stumbles you'd like silently corrected (`teh → the`, `recieve → receive`)
- Long invented names you'd prefer to invoke by a short pet form (`Aris → Aristarchus the Wise`)
- Shorthand for stock phrases you write daily (`omw → on my way`, `eta → estimated time of arrival`)

**When to turn it off:**

- You're drafting in a context where literal triggers must remain literal (technical notes, code comments inside prose)
- A particular replacement is firing where you didn't intend it — switch its **On** checkbox off, or refine the trigger
- You'd like to compare a session with and without the feature engaged — that's exactly what the master toggle is for

**Notes for the careful:**

- Newline (Enter) is **not** a word-boundary trigger in this version. Type a space before pressing Enter if you want a replacement to fire on the last word of your message.
- A rule's order in the list is presentational, not load-bearing: case-sensitive rules always win over case-insensitive rules with the same trigger.
- You cannot register two case-insensitive rules with the same trigger (the system politely declines with a conflict notice). Two rules with the same trigger but different case-sensitivity flags are perfectly legal.

### Avatar Settings

Controls how your user avatar appears in chats.

**Setting Options:**

- **Avatar Mode** — Choose how to display your avatar:
  - **Initials** — Show your initials (e.g., "JD" for John Doe)
  - **Image** — Use an image from your image library
  - **Emoji** — Use a single emoji character

- **Display Style** — Customize appearance:
  - **Circle** — Round avatar
  - **Square** — Square with rounded corners
  - **Rounded Square** — Square with more rounded corners
  - **Full Square** — Sharp square corners

- **Background Color** — Pick a background color for the avatar

**How to change:**

1. Choose your preferred mode and style
2. Changes apply immediately to all chats
3. If using image mode, select which image to display

### Cheap LLM Configuration

Configure a fallback LLM for lower-cost operations. Quilltap can use a cheaper model for certain operations, reserving your main profile for complex tasks.

**Setting Options:**

- **Enable Cheap LLM** — Toggle this feature on/off
- **Cheap LLM Profile** — Select which connection profile to use for cheaper operations
- **Operations** — Controls which operations use the cheap profile:
  - Image descriptions
  - Summary generation
  - Memory indexing
  - Title generation for chats
  - Other low-complexity tasks

**How to configure:**

1. Click **Enable Cheap LLM**
2. Choose a connection profile from the dropdown (must be created in Connection Profiles tab)
3. The selected profile is used for cost-saving operations
4. Your main profile is used for actual chat interactions

**Benefits:**

- Save on API costs
- Use fast models for background operations
- Reserve expensive models for direct chat

**Prerequisites:**

- At least two connection profiles must exist
- Must have an API key for the cheap provider

### Image Description Settings

Configure which service generates automatic descriptions for images in chats.

**Setting Options:**

- **Image Description Provider** — Select which profile to use:
  - Choose from available connection profiles
  - Or disable image descriptions entirely
  - Profiles may require specific provider support

**How to configure:**

1. Select a connection profile that supports vision/image analysis
2. This profile is used whenever an image needs a description
3. Descriptions appear automatically when images are shared

**What happens:**

- When an image is attached to a chat message, Quilltap automatically generates a description
- The description helps the AI understand the image context
- Descriptions are cached to save on API usage

**Prerequisites:**

- Connection profile must support image/vision capabilities
- Not all models support vision — check your profile settings

### Memory Cascade Settings

Controls how chat memory is managed, summarized, and stored over time.

**Setting Options:**

- **Memory Mode** — Choose how memory is handled:
  - **Full History** — Keep all messages in memory
  - **Sliding Window** — Keep only recent messages
  - **Summarization** — Summarize old messages to preserve context
  - **Hybrid** — Combination of summarization and recent messages

- **Retention Settings:**
  - **Keep Recent Messages** — How many recent messages to always remember
  - **Summarization Threshold** — When to start summarizing old messages
  - **Summary Length** — How detailed summaries should be

- **Cascade Behavior:**
  - **Character Memory** — How memory affects character knowledge
  - **Chat Memory** — How memory affects individual chat history
  - **Search Behavior** — How memory affects semantic search

**How to configure:**

1. Select a memory mode based on your needs
2. Adjust thresholds for when summarization occurs
3. Settings apply to all new chats created after changing

**When to use each mode:**

- **Full History** — Short, focused conversations
- **Sliding Window** — Medium-length chats with varied topics
- **Summarization** — Long-running, complex conversations
- **Hybrid** — Best for most use cases

**Prerequisites:**

- Embedding profiles may be required for semantic memory operations
- Memory cascade requires embedding search to be functional

### Context Compression Settings

Optimizes how conversation context is managed for efficiency.

**Setting Options:**

- **Enable Compression** — Toggle context compression on/off
- **Compression Method:**
  - **Simple** — Basic token counting
  - **Intelligent** — Learns which parts of context matter
  - **Aggressive** — Removes more context for cost savings

- **Compression Threshold** — When to start compressing context:
  - Token limit before compression starts
  - Prevents token limit overages
  - Helps manage API costs

**How it works:**

Context compression applies only to **conversation history** — the message log that accumulates as you chat. Each character's system prompt (their identity, personality, and instructions) is never compressed, ensuring characters always maintain their distinct voice and personality.

In multi-character chats, each character maintains their own compression cache. This is necessary because different characters may have different views of the conversation — a character who joined late only sees messages after their arrival, whispers are filtered per-recipient, and absent characters don't see messages that occurred while they were away.

**How to configure:**

1. Enable compression if dealing with long conversations
2. Choose compression method (Intelligent is usually best)
3. Set threshold based on your model's token limits
4. Monitor token usage to optimize

### Token Display Settings

Controls whether token counts are shown in the UI.

**Setting Options:**

- **Show Token Counts** — Toggle token display on/off
- **Show in Messages** — Display tokens per message
- **Show Totals** — Display total tokens for entire chat
- **Detailed Breakdown** — Show input/output token split

**How to configure:**

1. Enable token display to see usage
2. Choose what level of detail to show
3. Helpful for monitoring API costs
4. Can be toggled per chat if enabled globally

**When useful:**

- Monitoring API usage and costs
- Debugging token limit issues
- Optimizing prompts for efficiency

### LLM Logging Settings

Controls whether interactions with AI providers are logged and stored.

**Setting Options:**

- **Enable LLM Logging** — Toggle logging on/off
- **Log Level:**
  - **Full** — Log complete interactions
  - **Summary** — Log only key information
  - **Minimal** — Log only errors and usage stats

- **Retention:**
  - **Keep logs for** — How long logs are stored (7 days, 30 days, forever)
  - **Auto-cleanup** — Automatically delete old logs

**How to configure:**

1. Enable logging to track all LLM interactions
2. Choose log level based on your needs
3. Set retention policy for storage

**When useful:**

- Debugging conversation issues
- Auditing AI behavior
- Analyzing token usage patterns
- Troubleshooting provider problems

**Privacy Note:** Logs contain your chat content. Keep retention period reasonable if privacy is a concern.

### Story Backgrounds Settings

Configure AI-generated atmospheric background images for your chats.

**Setting Options:**

- **Enable Story Backgrounds** — Toggle automatic background generation on/off
- **Image Generation Profile** — Select which image profile to use for generating backgrounds:
  - Choose from available image generation profiles
  - If not set, uses the character's image profile or your default profile

**How it works:**

1. When enabled, Quilltap generates a landscape scene image after each chat title update
2. The scene features your characters based on their physical descriptions
3. The chat title provides context for the scene (e.g., "Sunset conversation on the beach")
4. Generated images appear as subtle backgrounds (30% opacity) behind chat content

**Benefits:**

- Creates immersive visual context for roleplay and storytelling
- Backgrounds automatically update as the story progresses
- Preserves readability with semi-transparent overlay

**Prerequisites:**

- At least one image generation profile configured
- Valid API key for your image provider
- Characters with physical descriptions produce better results

**Learn more:** See [Story Backgrounds](story-backgrounds.md) for detailed information.

### Per-Conversation Avatar Generation

Controls whether Quilltap generates unique AI portraits for each character in a chat. When enabled, character avatars are created automatically based on their physical descriptions and current outfits, giving each conversation its own visual identity — rather like commissioning a portrait painter for every new gathering.

**Setting Options:**

- **Enable Avatar Generation** — Toggle per-conversation avatar generation on or off. Available both when creating a new chat and (as **Auto-generate Character Avatars**) in the Chat Sidebar's **Chat** drawer during active conversations.
- **Regenerate Avatar** — In the Chat Sidebar's **Participants** drawer, click the refresh button on any character's portrait to queue a new avatar. Useful after outfit changes or when the muse simply failed to capture the right likeness the first time.

**How it works:**

1. When enabled on chat creation, avatars are generated for all LLM-controlled characters as soon as the chat begins
2. When toggled on during an active chat, generation is queued for all LLM characters
3. Avatars update automatically when outfit changes occur (if enabled)
4. Generated avatars appear in the Chat Sidebar's **Participants** drawer and are specific to that conversation

**Prerequisites:**

- At least one image generation profile configured
- Characters with physical descriptions produce significantly better results
- The wardrobe system enhances avatar accuracy — equipped outfits are included in the generation prompt

### Automation Settings

Controls automatic behavior during chat interactions.

**Setting Options:**

- **Auto-Detect RNG Calls** — Automatically detect and execute dice rolls, coin flips, and "spin the bottle" commands in both your messages and character responses:
  - **Dice notation**: Patterns like "2d6", "d20", "3d10" are detected and rolled automatically
  - **Coin flips**: Phrases like "flip a coin" trigger automatic coin flips
  - **Spin the bottle**: Phrases like "spin the bottle" randomly select a chat participant

**How it works:**

1. When enabled (default), Quilltap scans both your messages and character responses for RNG patterns
2. For your messages: patterns are executed before sending, results appear before your message
3. For character responses: patterns are executed after the response, results appear after
4. Results appear as tool messages in the chat, visible to all participants

**Why this is useful:**

- When a character says "I roll a d20 to attack", the dice actually get rolled
- Creates immersive tabletop RPG experiences where dice mentions become real rolls
- Both you and the AI can trigger random events naturally through conversation

**When to disable:**

- When discussing dice or probability without wanting actual rolls
- When you prefer to use the manual RNG tool via **Run Tool…** in the Chat Sidebar's Chat drawer
- When writing content that mentions dice notation without wanting it executed

**Example patterns detected:**

- "I roll 2d6 for damage" → Executes 2d6 roll
- "Let's flip a coin" → Executes coin flip
- "Spin the bottle to see who goes next" → Randomly selects a participant
- Character: *"I roll a d20"* → Executes d20 roll after the response

### Timestamp Injection & Timezone

Controls whether Quilltap injects the current date and time into the system prompt sent to the LLM, so the character knows what time it is — rather like winding a pocket watch before a conversation.

**Timestamp Mode:**

- **Disabled** — No timestamp is injected
- **Conversation Start** — Include the time only in the initial system prompt
- **Every Message** — Update the timestamp with each message sent
- **Every X Minutes** — The Host announces the time only when at least the configured number of minutes (defaulting to fifteen, like a stationmaster glancing at his pocket watch each quarter-hour) have elapsed since the last announcement. The first message of a conversation always receives an announcement.

**Timestamp Format:**

- **Friendly** — Human-readable (e.g., "February 22, 2026 at 2:30 PM")
- **ISO 8601** — Machine-readable with timezone offset (e.g., "2026-02-22T14:30:00-05:00")
- **Date Only** — Just the date, no time
- **Time Only** — Just the time, no date
- **Custom** — Use your own format string with date-fns tokens

**Timezone:**

By default, Quilltap shows timestamps in the server's timezone — which, if you're running in Docker, Lima, or WSL2, is quite likely to be UTC. This is rather like a clock permanently set to Greenwich Mean Time while you're sipping cocktails in New York.

To remedy this situation:

1. **Automatic detection (Electron app):** The desktop app detects your operating system's timezone and passes it through to the server automatically. No action required on your part.
2. **Per-chat override:** In the timestamp configuration for any chat, set a specific timezone from the searchable list.
3. **Salon-level default:** In Chat Settings, set a default timezone that applies to all timestamp formatting.
4. **Docker users:** Set the `QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE` environment variable when starting the container:
   ```
   docker run -e QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE=America/New_York ...
   ```

The timezone resolution follows a courteous chain of precedence: per-chat setting wins, then the Salon default, then the `QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE` environment variable, and finally the server's system timezone.

**Fictional Time:**

For those engaged in period dramas or interstellar adventures, toggle "Use fictional time" to inject a made-up timestamp that advances in real time from a base you specify. The timezone setting still applies to how the fictional time is formatted.

## Saving Chat Settings

Most settings save automatically as you make changes. You'll see:

- **Checkmark icon** — Setting was saved
- **Loading spinner** — Setting is being saved
- **Error message** — Setting failed to save (try again)

## Troubleshooting Chat Settings

### Settings won't save

**Solution:**

- Check your internet connection
- Try refreshing the page
- Look for error message explaining the issue
- Contact support if problem persists

### Token counts seem wrong

**Solution:**

- Token counting varies by model
- Some providers round differently
- This is normal and expected
- Check provider's documentation for exact counting method

### Memory cascade isn't working

**Solution:**

- Verify embedding profiles are configured
- Check that memory cascade is enabled
- Ensure sufficient embeddings vocabulary
- May require restart of chat

### Cheap LLM not being used

**Solution:**

- Verify cheap LLM is enabled
- Check that profile exists and is valid
- Only certain operations use cheap profile
- Chat messages always use main profile

### Image descriptions missing

**Solution:**

- Verify image description provider is configured
- Check that profile supports vision/images
- Some providers don't support vision
- Try updating to a newer model that supports vision

## In-Chat Settings Access

Characters with help tools enabled can read your current chat settings during a conversation using the `help_settings` tool with `category: "chat"`. This returns your token display, context compression, memory cascade, timestamp, agent mode, dangerous content, automation, and LLM logging settings. Simply ask a help-tools-enabled character something like "What are my chat settings?" and it will look them up for you.

## In-Chat Navigation

Characters with help tools enabled can navigate directly to this page:

`help_navigate(url: "/settings?tab=chat")`
