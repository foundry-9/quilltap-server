## Recent Changes

### 4.12.2

#### Fix: OpenAI model fetch lists GPT-6 and later

- Fetch Models for OpenAI kept only IDs starting `gpt-4`, `gpt-5`, `o1`, `o3`, `o4`, so the gpt-6.x models never appeared. The reasoning-model and 24h cache-retention checks had the same hard-coded lists, so a hand-entered gpt-6 model would also have been sent `temperature` / `top_p`.
- The OpenAI plugin (1.0.69) now decides by family and version in `model-families.ts`: chat models are gpt-4 and later plus every o-series (gpt-3.5 drops out); reasoning models are gpt-5 and later plus every o-series; 24h retention is gpt-5.1 / 5.2 / 5.5 and every gpt-6+ model except `-chat-latest` aliases.
- Retention for unreleased models is a guess, so a 400 naming `prompt_cache_retention` is retried once without it instead of failing the turn.

### 4.12.1

#### Fixed: dated searches look at the period first, and an empty search says what it means

- A `search` with `since`/`until` (and a retrospective turn's recall) now reads the period's memories by event time in SQL (`MemoriesRepository.findIdsInEventWindow`) and scores them through the same index restricted to those ids (`memoryIndex.search` `includeIds`), so they join the candidate pool before the cut. Previously the window was applied to a pool already chosen from all time, so a dated question about a recurring place returned nothing. New `HitSource` `'window'`; the `gather` trace stage records `window` / `windowAdded`.
- On the tool path, a window of 14 days or less (`TOOL_WINDOW_FLOOR_MAX_DAYS`) is its own relevance filter: in-window memories and conversation chunks skip the cosine floor. Wider windows and the per-turn prompt path keep the floor.
- Conversation search takes `chatIds`; with a window, the tool restricts the chunk search to the period's chats (`findChatsInWindow`, `lib/scriptorium/chat-window.ts`) instead of filtering the all-time top-K afterwards. A chat's span is `createdAt` to `lastMessageAt`, not `updatedAt`. `searchConversationChunks` now honours an explicit `minScore: 0`.
- When `since`/`until` is given and `sources` is omitted, only memories and conversations are searched (conversations alone on the Brahma Console).
- The tool result carries a `windowCensus` (memories dated in the window, the conversations the character took part in during it, the current chat left out). An empty result now says whether nothing matched the words or nothing happened in the period, and names the period's conversations; non-empty dated results gain a footer listing them.
- Standing tool instructions (native and simple-JSON) now tell the character to read a listed conversation before saying it does not recall.
- The retrospective mini-recap lists in-window chats that have no vault summary yet, from the `chats` table. `VaultConversationMatch.relativePath` is now nullable.
- Undated searches and turns without a resolved time window are unchanged. No schema or export change.
- Spec: `docs/developer/features/complete/search-window-first-and-honest-empty.md`.

#### CI: coverage run heap

- CI: the coverage run (`npm run test:coverage`) now gives the Jest parent process an 8 GB heap. With the v8 coverage provider, every worker ships the coverage, original source and transformed source of each module it loaded back to the parent, which holds all of it until the run ends; at ~1,300 test files that passed the default ~4 GB limit and the Test job died with "JavaScript heap out of memory" after the last suite.
