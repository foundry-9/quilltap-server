# A Character's Photo Album — The Aurora Gallery

Every character in your workshop maintains a photo album. You'll find it on the character's own page — under **Aurora**, in the gallery tab — a grid of every picture that has been deposited into that character's keeping. Portraits the character has favoured, scene illustrations they have asked the Lantern to summon and `keep_image`'d for posterity, and any photographs you have uploaded into their album yourself: all of them line up here, side by side.

## Where the pictures actually live

A character's album is not a separate filing system. It is the `photos/` folder inside the character's document vault — the same vault that holds their wardrobe and commonplace book. Each photograph is a hard link to the original image bytes, accompanied by a small Markdown context document carrying the generation prompt, a snapshot of the scene at the time, your caption, and any tags. (No bytes are duplicated; the same image may live in your own gallery, in three different characters' albums, and in a chat attachment, all at once, with only one copy on disk.)

The character's pre-existing portrait — the one you set as their avatar at character creation, or the one a SillyTavern card brought in — sits alongside the photographs in `photos/`. Old portraits stored under `images/avatar.webp` remain visible too, so the album is never empty for a long-tenured character.

## What you can do here

- **Upload** a new picture with the **Upload** button. Pick any image file from your machine; it is deposited directly into the character's vault `photos/` folder.
- **Set as avatar** — hover over any thumbnail and click the silhouette button. The character's `defaultImageId` is updated to point at the chosen photograph, and the new portrait propagates through the Salon, the chat list, the announcement bubbles, and every other place the character's face appears.
- **Clear avatar** — drop the current portrait without choosing a replacement.
- **Delete a photograph** — hover and click the bin, then click it again to confirm. The link is severed; if your character's album was the last place holding a hand on those bytes, the bytes themselves are garbage-collected. (If another character's album, a chat attachment, your own *My Photos* gallery, or any other link still points at the picture, the bytes stay where they are.)
- **Zoom in and out** with the magnifier controls to make the thumbnails larger or smaller.

## How a photograph ends up in the album

There are three principal routes:

1. **You upload it.** The Upload button on this very page.
2. **The character keeps it during chat.** When a character has the **Document Editing** tools enabled and they generate (or are shown) an image in the Salon, they may invoke `keep_image` to file the picture in their own album. See [The Photo Album — Keeping, Listing, and Re-Attaching Images](keep-image-tools.md) for the details.
3. **You set their avatar from a generated image.** The portrait gets written into the vault as part of the avatar pipeline.

## A note on what changed

In earlier versions, a character's gallery was assembled by trawling every image in the workspace and showing the ones that happened to be *tagged* with the character. That arrangement was clever but indirect: a picture's membership in a character's album depended on a flag scattered across the image system rather than living inside the character's own vault.

Quilltap now keeps each character's photographs where they conceptually belong — under the character's vault, in `photos/` — and the gallery you see here is simply the contents of that folder. A one-time migration moves every previously-tagged image into the matching character's vault on first startup; you should not notice anything missing.
