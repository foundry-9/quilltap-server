 *
 * TIMEZONE: this module's whole job is resolving calendar boundaries in the
 * SERVER-LOCAL zone, so the suite would ideally pin TZ. It can't: Jest hands
 * the test file a *copy* of `process.env`, so assigning `process.env.TZ` never
 * reaches V8's timezone cache, and the ambient zone leaks in either way.
 * Instead every expectation is computed through the same local-time API the
 * resolver uses, so the assertions hold in any zone — and the regression case
 * additionally proves the window is the LOCAL day rather than the UTC one
 * whenever the two differ. The live failure being pinned here: a user speaking
 * at 21:44 CDT on July 28 is already July 29 in UTC, and a UTC-day "today"
 * misses every memory from the day they are asking about.
