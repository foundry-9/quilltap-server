/**
 * Stale-chat asset collapse
 *
 * When a chat has gone quiet (no activity for STALE_CHAT_RETENTION_DAYS), the
 * generated story-backgrounds and wardrobe avatars it accumulated over its
 * lifetime are mostly dead weight: only the *currently-referenced* ones
 * (`chat.storyBackgroundImageId` and each `chat.characterAvatars[].imageId`)
 * still matter. This sweep deletes every other GENERATED image linked to the
 * stale chat, releasing the orphaned bytes through the existing hard-link GC.
 *
 * It is gated on CHAT staleness, never per-asset age — an active chat is never
 * touched no matter how many backgrounds it has piled up. The collapse is
 * non-destructive to the story: it removes only superseded background/avatar
 * variants, never messages or memories.
 *
 * ## Why this runs on the parent process
 * Deletion bottoms out in `docMountFileLinks.deleteWithGC`, which opens a write
 * transaction on the raw mount-index DB. That is impossible in the forked job
 * child (readonly connection + buffered writes), so this is invoked inline by
 * the parent-side maintenance scheduler, not as a background job.
 *
 * ## What it stores vs. what the spec assumed
 * `chat.storyBackgroundImageId` and `chat.characterAvatars[].imageId` hold
 * **`files.id`** values (freshly minted UUIDs used as the `files`-row PK by the
 * story-background / character-avatar handlers) — NOT `doc_mount_file_links.id`.
 * So we enumerate via `repos.files.findByLinkedTo(chatId)` and delete through
 * the end-to-end `deleteFileCompletely` chokepoint, which internally walks
 * `files.storageKey` → mount blob → `deleteWithGC`. Imports (or a future
 * migration) can still land link ids in those fields, so the keep-set is
 * resolved through `resolveCharacterAvatar` (link-id first, files.id fallback)
 * and matched on both id AND content sha256.
 *
 * ## Safety
 * A generated image the user saved to an album/gallery or promoted to a
 * character default is intentional content and must survive. We skip a
 * candidate when ANY of these holds (when unsure, skip):
 *  - its id is in the keep-set, or its sha256 matches a kept asset's sha256;
 *  - its bytes also surface as a `photos/` album link or a 'character'-vault
 *    link (via the sha256 reverse index); or
 *  - the file is referenced as a character `defaultImageId` or an
 *    `avatarOverrides[].imageId`.
 *
 * And if a chat's keep-set can't be fully resolved (a keep-id resolution
 * throws), the whole chat's collapse is skipped for that run rather than risk
 * deleting a current asset whose protecting sha256 went missing.
