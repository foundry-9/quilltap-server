# Project Scenarios

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/prospero)**

A scenario, in our particular sense of the word, is a sealed envelope handed to your characters at the moment a chat opens — a brief, evocative paragraph that establishes the setting, the tenor of the encounter, and the shape of the world they have just stepped into. Stored as plain Markdown files in a project's own document shelf, **Project Scenarios** are these envelopes drafted once and reused across every new chat in the project, sparing you the chore of re-typing the same opening every time you sit down with a familiar cast.

## What Sets Project Scenarios Apart

A character may, of course, carry her own personal scenarios — favourite settings she returns to, like a comfortable parlour. But a *project* scenario is one rung larger: it belongs to the project itself, and is offered to **every** chat begun within that project's confines, regardless of which character takes the stage. Imagine an Estate housing several characters; the Estate's grand hall, its rose garden, its Sunday teas — those belong to all who reside there, and so they belong to the project rather than to any single character.

For envelopes you'd like handed out at *every* chat, regardless of project, see [General Scenarios](general-scenarios.md). When more than one default is in play, the project's wish wins out over the household custom.

When you start a new chat in a project that has scenarios on file, you'll see them in the same drop-down where character scenarios have always lived, neatly grouped under **Project Scenarios**. They sit shoulder-to-shoulder with the General Scenarios and any Character Scenarios on offer, and you may pick from any group — or write a one-off "Custom" scenario in the textarea below as before.

## The Files Themselves

Each scenario lives as a Markdown file inside a folder called `Scenarios/` within the project's official document store (the auto-created store named `Project Files: <your project name>`). The folder is conjured automatically the moment you visit the project page, so you needn't perform any incantation to bring it into being.

A scenario file may carry a small block of **YAML frontmatter** at the top, in which the file declares its own metadata:

```yaml
---
name: Welcome to the Estate
description: A summer evening, the triad gathered in the conservatory.
isDefault: true
---

The conservatory glows amber as the sun lowers itself into the rose garden.
{{char}} has just poured a fresh cup of tea, and {{user}} is settling
into the wicker chair by the window…
```

- **`name`** — The display title shown in the new-chat drop-down. If absent, the filename (stripped of its `.md`) stands in.
- **`description`** — A one-line subtitle shown beneath the name. Optional but charming.
- **`isDefault`** — Marks this scenario as the project's standing selection. Exactly one file should claim this honour; if more than one does, the alphabetically-earliest one wins and a soft warning is offered.

The body of the file (everything after the closing `---`) is the scenario content proper — the text spliced into the system prompt at chat creation. The familiar substitutions, `{{char}}` and `{{user}}`, are honoured at chat time exactly as they are in character scenarios.

## Tending the Collection

The **Scenarios** card on each project's page is your atelier. Every project automatically grows one of these cards, and from it you may:

- **Create** a new scenario via the **+ New scenario** button. A modal opens, complete with the same Markdown editor used elsewhere in the workspace; you supply a filename, a display name, an optional description, and the body. Tick the **Use this scenario as the project default for new chats** box if you wish to enthrone it.
- **Edit** an existing scenario by clicking its **Edit** button. The same modal returns, this time pre-filled with the scenario's contents.
- **Rename** the underlying file via **Rename** — useful when the scenario has matured beyond its original working title. The file moves; the body stays exactly as it was.
- **Delete** a scenario with the **Delete** button, after a moment's confirmation. The file is removed from the document store; chats that already used it are unaffected, since the scenario text is woven into the chat at the moment of its creation.
- **Set the default** by clicking the radio button at the start of a row. The newly elected default has its frontmatter rewritten to `isDefault: true`, and any sibling that previously claimed the title is gently demoted.

Should a scenario file have multiple defaults claimed (perhaps after editing the files directly through the Scriptorium), the card surfaces a soft warning naming the conflicting files so you may resolve the dispute at your leisure.

## Picking a Scenario for a New Chat

When you begin a new chat within a project, the **Starting Scenario** drop-down on the new-chat form will offer:

- **Project Scenarios** — the contents of the project's `Scenarios/` folder.
- **Character Scenarios** — the personal scenarios of the single character you've chosen, if exactly one LLM-controlled character is selected.
- **Custom...** — the textarea you've always known, for a one-off scenario typed on the spot.

The **project default** takes precedence when seeding the form's initial selection. If the chosen character also has a default scenario of her own, you'll see an inline note naming her default and offering a single click to switch to it — the override is never silent. You remain in charge of which scenario opens the curtain.

## Keeping the Folder Healthy

Should you, in some moment of housekeeping zeal, delete the `Scenarios/` folder or even the entire `Project Files:` document store, fear not — both are reconstructed at the next server start (and at the next visit to the project page, whichever comes first). The structure reappears empty, ready for fresh scenarios; previously-deleted files do not return.
