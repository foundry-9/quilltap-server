/**
 * Realtime Provider
 *
 * Wires the shared invalidation socket to this tab's QueryClient. Mounts once,
 * inside `QueryProvider`, and renders nothing.
 *
 * The contract is deliberately one-way and content-free: the server says
 * *something under this topic changed*, and we mark the matching query keys
 * stale. TanStack then refetches whatever is actually on screen through the
 * ordinary HTTP API, which stays the single source of truth for what the data
 * is. Invalidating a key nothing is watching is a no-op, which is why the
 * server can broadcast every event to every tab without a subscription
 * protocol.
 *
 * On (re)connect we invalidate every prefix this build knows about. A client
 * that was disconnected has no way to learn what it missed, so it re-reads
 * everything the socket could have told it about — the catch-up that makes a
 * dropped connection a latency problem rather than a correctness one.
 *
