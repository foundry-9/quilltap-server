# AI Character Import

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/aurora)**

The AI Character Import tool — known affectionately as **Summon From Lore** — lets you generate complete characters from source material like wiki pages, story documents, character sheets, or freeform notes. Instead of manually copying fields into the character editor, an AI analyzes your source material and creates a fully-populated character with descriptions, system prompts, memories, and more.

## Accessing AI Character Import

1. Navigate to the **Characters** page (`/aurora`)
2. Click the **Summon From Lore** button in the toolbar
3. The wizard opens in a large dialog overlay

## How It Works

The wizard uses a multi-step AI approach:

1. Your source material is sent to the AI in focused calls, each extracting one aspect of the character
2. The AI generates character basics, dialogue, system prompts, physical descriptions, pronouns, and optionally memories and example chats
3. All generated content is assembled into Quilltap's native `.qtap` export format
4. The result is validated and imported through the standard import system

The AI never generates technical data like IDs or timestamps — those are handled programmatically, ensuring data integrity.

## Wizard Steps

### Step 1: Source Material

Provide the material the AI will analyze:

- **Upload Files** — Drag and drop or browse for `.txt`, `.md`, or `.pdf` files containing character information. You can upload multiple files.
- **Freeform Text** — Paste any additional character information, backstory, personality notes, or wiki content into the text area.

You need at least one file or some text to proceed.

### Step 2: Configuration

- **Connection Profile** — Choose which AI provider and model to use for generation. The default profile is pre-selected.
- **Generate Memories** — When checked, the AI extracts key facts and experiences as Commonplace Book memories. Default: on.
- **Generate Example Chat** — When checked, the AI creates a sample conversation demonstrating the character's voice. Default: off.

### Step 3: Generation

Watch the AI work through each extraction step:

| Step | What It Does |
|------|-------------|
| Analyzing Source Material | Summarizes large source documents (only for long texts) |
| Extracting Character Basics | Name, title, identity, description, manifesto, personality, and an initial scenario (title and content) |
| Generating Dialogue | First message and example dialogue exchanges |
| Creating System Prompts | Instructions for AI roleplay behavior |
| Describing Appearance | Physical descriptions at 5 detail levels for image generation |
| Generating Wardrobe | Slot-typed clothing, accessories, and hairstyles (top, bottom, footwear, accessories, hair), each with an image-generation cue, plus one or two composite outfits — the everyday one marked as the character's default |
| Determining Pronouns & Aliases | Subject/object/possessive pronouns, and any nicknames the source material establishes |
| Generating Memories | Key facts and experiences (if enabled) |
| Creating Example Chat | Sample conversation (if enabled) |
| Assembling Export | Builds the `.qtap` file |
| Validating Data | Checks data integrity |

Each step shows its status: pending, in progress, complete, or warning. Non-critical failures (like dialogue generation) won't block the import — only character basics are required.

### Step 4: Review & Import

Review the generated character before importing:

- **Character Summary** — Name, title, pronouns, aliases, and description preview
- **Generated Content** — Which fields were successfully generated and which had issues
- **Content Counts** — Number of memories, system prompts, wardrobe items and outfits, and chat messages generated

Three actions are available:

- **Import Character** — Imports the character into Quilltap immediately
- **Add More & Regenerate** — Go back to Step 1 with existing material preserved, add new sources, and re-run generation. Only failed or missing steps re-run.
- **Start Over** — Clear everything and begin fresh

## Field Vantage Points and Buckets

Summon From Lore distinguishes the character fields by *vantage point*, plus the buckets that sit alongside them. The AI is instructed not to mix them up — the same trait should not appear in two places.

- **Identity** — outside view; what strangers know on sight or by reputation (name, station, occupation, public reputation). Never private mannerisms or appearance. Written about the character from outside, because only *others* ever read it: *"Ariadne is a research librarian at the Athenaeum."*
- **Description** — acquaintance view; behaviour, mannerisms, frequent verbal patterns. Never physical appearance — that lives in physical descriptions. Written about the character from outside, like Identity: *"She finishes other people's sentences and apologises afterwards."*
- **Manifesto** — axiomatic core; the character's foundational tenets and most important facts of existence. Load-bearing truths that every other field should remain consistent with. Never opinions or trends. Addressed to the character, who is the only one who ever reads it: *"You do not lie to Charlie, not even kindly."*
- **Personality** — internal view; the character's own self-knowledge, inner drivers, motivations, beliefs. Addressed to the character, whose self-knowledge it is: *"You keep your worry behind your teeth."*
- **System prompts** — stage direction for the model, written as though speaking to the character (*"You are…"*, *"You always…"*); how to perform the character, not lore about them.
- **Properties** — structured facts: pronouns and aliases. Only extracted when the source material actually supports them — the AI never invents placeholder pronouns.
- **Physical descriptions** — appearance only, with nothing removable; generated as a separate step in five detail levels. Bare descriptive phrases, never addressed to anyone — this text also feeds the image models, which want nouns, not sentences about "you": *"auburn hair cut short; grey eyes; a scar across the left knuckle."*
- **Wardrobe** — everything removable: clothing, accessories, and composite outfits, kept strictly apart from the physical description.

If your source material describes a character's looks, those details flow into the physical descriptions; her habitual coat flows into the wardrobe, not into her body's description. Similarly, foundational tenets (core beliefs, immutable principles) flow into the manifesto, not into personality or description.

The system prompts the wizard writes also carry the safeguards described under [Whose story it is](prompts.md): what you narrate is what happened, the conversation outranks the character's notes, no setting facts are invented to win an argument, nothing binds you unless you agreed in plain words, and disagreement never hardens into votes, sign-offs, or standing conditions on your persona. They are written in the character's own voice and idiom, not pasted in as a rule list, and they bind a sworn enemy as surely as a dear friend. A *disposition of trust* is added only when the source material (or the wizard's own reading of the character's relationships) establishes the character as your companion, partner, family, or crew; when the relationship is neutral, professional, adversarial, or simply unknown, it is left out.

## Tips

- **Better source material = better results.** Detailed wiki pages or character sheets produce more accurate characters than brief notes.
- **Use multiple files.** Upload a wiki page for backstory plus a separate document for personality notes.
- **Try different models.** If results are unsatisfying, try a different connection profile with a more capable model.
- **Iterate.** Use "Add More & Regenerate" to refine results by adding more context.
- **Memories improve roleplay.** Generated memories give the character knowledge to draw on during conversations.
