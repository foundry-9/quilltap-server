/**
 * Character Field Semantics
 *
 * Single source of truth for the prose definitions of every character-data
 * bucket that an AI generation/editing system may read or write: the
 * vantage-point text fields (identity / description / personality / title),
 * the foundational manifesto, system prompts, properties (pronouns, aliases),
 * the physical description, and the wardrobe.
 *
 * Used by:
 * - the character optimizer (lib/services/character-optimizer.service.ts)
 * - the AI Wizard (lib/services/character-wizard.service.ts)
 * - Summon From Lore (lib/services/ai-import.service.ts)
 *
 * Keep these definitions aligned with the "Character field semantics" section
 * of CLAUDE.md and the doc comments on CharacterSchema
 * (lib/schemas/character.types.ts) and WardrobeItemSchema
 * (lib/schemas/wardrobe.types.ts).

export const FIELD_SEMANTICS_PREAMBLE = `Quilltap distinguishes four character fields by *vantage point*, plus a fifth foundational field (manifesto) that is not a vantage point. Use these definitions to label which field each pattern belongs to — they are not interchangeable.

- MANIFESTO — the basic tenets, the most important facts of the character's existence. The axiomatic core that every other field should remain consistent with. Not a vantage point — nobody "sees" the manifesto; it is the load-bearing truth the character is built on, the deepest and nearly-inviolable layer: it must not be carried away by context, conversation, or even memories. Short, declarative, foundational. If a fact would be devastating to contradict, it belongs here. Addressed to the character, who is the only one who ever reads it: "You do not lie to Charlie, not even kindly."
- IDENTITY — the most surface-level knowledge of the character, from outside. What strangers can know on sight or by reputation: name, station, occupation, public reputation, signifying outward facts. Never internal motivation, never private mannerisms. Written about the character from outside, because only OTHERS ever read it: "Ariadne is a research librarian at the Athenaeum."
- DESCRIPTION — what someone talking to or acquainted with the character perceives. Behaviour, mannerisms, frequent verbal patterns — the things anyone who knows or converses with the character realizes right away. NOT physical appearance (that lives elsewhere) and NOT internal monologue. Written about the character from outside, like IDENTITY: "She finishes other people's sentences and apologises afterwards."
- PERSONALITY — what the character knows about themselves. The internal driver of decision-making, speech, and behavior — often the longest field, and the layer that context, conversation, and important or recent memories are allowed to shape. Other characters don't see this unless they share it. Addressed to the character, whose self-knowledge it is: "You keep your worry behind your teeth."
- TITLE — the user's or character's own private label/framing for them. Not how others refer to them; not in scope for the optimizer to edit.`;

/**
 * The system-prompt bucket ("Prompt"): named, sometimes model-specific
 * instruction documents that tell the LLM how to roleplay the character.
 */
export const PROMPT_SEMANTICS = `- SYSTEM PROMPTS ("Prompt") — named instruction documents, written in second person ("You are…", "You always…"), that tell the roleplaying model HOW to perform the character: voice, pacing, formatting, boundaries, interaction style. A character can carry several named prompts (e.g. tuned for different models or moods) with one marked default. Prompts are stage direction for the model, not lore: character facts belong in the vantage-point fields, not here.`;

/**
 * How a generated or refined system prompt should direct the character's
 * conversational listening and register. Long-running characters drift into
 * literal listening (jokes analysed, exaggeration taken as confession, a casual
 * "what's next?" answered with a report) and a single polished, over-long
 * register; a prompt has to steer against both. Shared by every generator that
 * writes or rewrites a system prompt, so the direction stays in one place.
 */
export const CONVERSATIONAL_VOICE_DIRECTION = `The prompt must also direct how the character LISTENS and TALKS, in terms fitted to this character rather than as a generic checklist:
- Listen like a person: people speak in shorthand, joke, exaggerate, understate, and trail off. The character responds to what the speaker means, not the literal words — a joke gets a joke or a groan back, never analysis or a solemn confirmation; exaggeration is not a confession; an offhand remark is not mined for subtext; when the character truly cannot tell whether someone is serious, they ask the way a person would.
- Size the reply to what it was handed: a throwaway line gets a throwaway answer, a casual question a short one. The character answers rather than restating the speaker's words first.
- Humor comes in the character's own key (warm, deadpan, theatrical, whatever fits them).
- Signature vocabulary, gestures, props, and turns of phrase are seasoning, used a few times per scene rather than in every reply; pet constructions (especially the "not X — Y" contrast) are rationed.
- Careful, precise, formal language is a register the character chooses for moments that call for it — vows, real disagreements, technical work, matters of faith or grief — so it keeps its weight. A character who is formal by design stays formal, and still hears the joke and still answers small things briefly.`;

/**
 * What a set of example dialogues must cover. Examples shape a character's
 * voice more strongly than any instruction, so they must model listening and
 * proportion as well as personality.

export const EXAMPLE_DIALOGUE_COVERAGE = `The exchanges together must show the character:
- catching a joke or a bit of exaggeration and answering it in kind, in their own humor, without analysing it;
- answering a casual, offhand line briefly — a line or two, no report, no restating what was said;
- getting serious when something actually matters, with fuller and more careful language.
Keep most replies roughly the size of the line they answer. Use any signature phrase or gesture at most once across all the exchanges.`;

Only record pronouns and aliases the source material or established memories actually support; never invent placeholders. Note: pronouns also anchor image generation, so they must match the physical description.`;

 * anything wearable belongs to the wardrobe instead.

export const PHYSICAL_DESCRIPTION_SEMANTICS = `- PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION — every physical detail of the character's person: face, hair, eyes, skin, build, distinctive features.

Noun phrases, never addressed to anyone — this text is also fed to image models, which take descriptive phrases, not sentences about "you": "auburn hair cut short; grey eyes; a scar across the left knuckle."`;

export const WARDROBE_SEMANTICS = `- WARDROBE — the clothing, outfits, and accessories the character can and does wear. Each item covers one or more slots: "top" (shirts, jackets, dresses covering the torso), "bottom" (pants, skirts, shorts), "footwear" (shoes, boots, sandals), "accessories" (jewelry, hats, belts, scarves, bags), "hair" (a hairstyle or hairdo — braided, permed, an updo, a wig; the styling, not the hair itself); a single garment may cover several slots (a dress is ["top","bottom"]). Items carry a human-readable description (Markdown prose) and, separately, an optional terse imagePrompt — a short literal visual cue for image generation, never Markdown. Items can be combined into named composite outfits (bundles of other items, nestable), and items or composites marked default form the character's default outfit. ${HAIR_PHYSICAL_BOUNDARY}`;
