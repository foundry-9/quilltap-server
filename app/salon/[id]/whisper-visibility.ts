 * whispered so the *characters* can't see them, and the person running the
 * table is the audience they exist for. Everything else a Staff member
 * whispers — the Commonplace Book's recall, Carina's answers to a character,
 * the Librarian, the Host — is addressed to a character as part of the scene,
 * and stays behind the toggle like any other whisper the human isn't party to.
 *
 * Keep this narrow. A blanket `systemSender` exemption is what leaked the
 * Commonplace Book's recall whispers into the flow.
