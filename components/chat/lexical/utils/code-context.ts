/**
 * True when the cursor sits somewhere a typing aid must NOT fire.
 *
 * Covers the two ways code is represented, which are easy to conflate and must
 * both be checked:
 *
 * 1. **Fenced blocks** — the enclosing top-level element is a `CodeNode`. Note
 *    that the anchor node itself is no help here: `CodeHighlightNode` *extends*
 *    `TextNode`, so `$isTextNode` is true inside a fenced block. That is exactly
 *    the trap bug 63 fell into.
 * 2. **Inline code** — an ordinary `TextNode` carrying the `code` format bit.
 *
 * Conservative by design: an absent top-level element, or one that is not an
 * `ElementNode`, also returns true. We cannot prove such a position is safe, and
 * a typing aid that stays quiet beats one that corrupts.
 *
 * The `$isElementNode` narrowing is load-bearing, not decoration —
 * `getTopLevelElement()` is not guaranteed to hand back something `$isCodeNode`
 * can inspect. Do not drop it.
 *
 * Must be called inside an `editor.read()` / `editor.update()` context, which is
 * what the `$` prefix signals.
