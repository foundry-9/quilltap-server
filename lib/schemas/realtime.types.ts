 * stays the single source of truth for the data itself; the socket only says
 * when to look again.
 *
 * Client-safe — types and Zod only, no server imports.

 * each of the two files. The wire schema still accepts *any* string, so a
 * server that learns a new topic can't break an older tab — see
 * `lib/realtime/topic-map.ts`, which ignores what it doesn't recognise.
