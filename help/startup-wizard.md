# Getting Started with Quilltap

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/)**

Welcome to Quilltap! This guide walks you through everything you need to get started, from setting up your first AI connection to having your first conversation with a character.

## Before You Begin

### What You'll Set Up

When you first launch Quilltap, you'll be guided through a few quick setup steps:

1. **Encryption Setup** — Quilltap generates an encryption key to protect your data (automatic)
2. **Your Profile** — Tell Quilltap your name and pick an archetype so characters know who they're talking to
3. **Connection Profile** — How Quilltap talks to an AI service
4. **Embedding Profile** — How Quilltap searches your memories (optional but recommended)
5. **Cheap LLM** — A cost-saving option for background tasks (optional)
6. **Your First Chat** — Starting a conversation with a character

### First Run: Encryption, Profile, and Provider Setup

On your very first launch, Quilltap will walk you through three initial steps:

1. **Encryption Setup** (`/setup`) — An encryption key is generated automatically to protect your API keys and sensitive data. You can optionally protect it with a passphrase.

2. **Profile Setup** (`/setup/profile`) — You'll enter your name and choose an archetype that describes how you interact with your characters.

3. **AI Stack Setup Wizard** (`/setup/providers`) — A guided wizard walks you through selecting providers, entering API keys, choosing models, and configuring embeddings and images. See [AI Stack Setup Wizard](setup-wizard.md) for full details.

After completing the wizard, you can re-run it anytime from the **AI Providers** tab in Settings (`/settings?tab=providers`).

**Profile Setup** — You'll enter your name and choose an archetype:
   - **The Proprietor** — Direct and professional, focused on getting things done
   - **The Resident** — Curious and sociable, here to connect with characters
   - **The Author** — Imaginative and expressive, approaching characters as a storyteller

   This creates a user-controlled character that represents you in conversations. Characters will greet you by name and know a bit about your style. You can change your name, avatar, and details anytime from Aurora.

### Understanding the Basics

If you're new to AI chat applications, here are some terms you'll encounter:

**LLM (Large Language Model)**
The AI "brain" that powers conversations. Examples include GPT-4, Claude, Llama, and Mistral. Different models have different capabilities, speeds, and costs.

**API Key**
A secret password that lets Quilltap access an AI service on your behalf. You get this from the AI provider (like OpenAI or Anthropic). Keep it private — anyone with your key can use your account.

**Provider**
The company or service that runs the AI. Examples: OpenAI (makes GPT-4), Anthropic (makes Claude), or Ollama (runs AI locally on your computer).

**Tokens**
How AI services measure usage. Roughly, 1 token ≈ 4 characters of text. Most providers charge based on tokens used.

**Embeddings**
A way to convert text into numbers so the AI can search and compare meanings. Used for finding relevant memories during conversations.

These work with Quilltap's "OpenAI" provider setting — you just need to specify the custom base URL.

---

## Step 2: Add Your API Key to Quilltap

Now that you have an API key (or Ollama installed), let's add it to Quilltap.

### For Cloud Providers (OpenRouter, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)

1. **Open Settings**
   - Click **Settings** (gear icon) in the left sidebar
   - Or go to: **Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Add a New API Key**
   - Click **Add API Key** or **+ New Key**

     - Choose **OpenRouter** for OpenRouter keys
     - Choose **OpenAI** for OpenAI keys (or OpenAI-compatible services)
     - Choose **Anthropic** for Anthropic/Claude keys
     - Choose **Google** for Google AI keys
   - Enter a **Label** (name) for this key, like "My OpenRouter Key"
   - Paste your **API Key** in the key field

3. **For Custom/Local Providers**
   - If using a local OpenAI-compatible server (like LM Studio):
     - Choose **OpenAI** as the provider
     - You'll set the custom URL later in the connection profile

4. **Save the Key**
   - Click **Save** or **Add Key**
   - Your key is now stored securely

5. **Test the Key (Optional)**
   - Click **Test** next to your saved key
   - If successful, you'll see a confirmation
   - If it fails, double-check that you copied the entire key

### For Ollama (Local)

Ollama doesn't require an API key, but you need Ollama running:

1. **Install Ollama** from [ollama.com](https://ollama.com)

2. **Download a Model**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt
   - Run: `ollama pull llama3.2` (or another model)
   - Wait for the download to complete

3. **Start Ollama**
   - Ollama usually runs automatically after installation
   - If not, run: `ollama serve`
   - It runs on `http://localhost:11434` by default
   - **Docker users:** No URL changes needed — add `11434` to `HOST_REDIRECT_PORTS` when running the container

4. **No API Key Needed**
   - Skip adding an API key
   - You'll connect directly to Ollama in the next step

## Step 3: Create a Connection Profile

A connection profile tells Quilltap which AI to use and how to use it. This is where you choose your model and configure settings.

1. **Open Connection Profiles**
   - Go to: **Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)

2. **Create a New Profile**
   - Click **Add Profile** or **+ New Profile**

3. **Configure the Profile**

   **Profile Name:**
   - Give it a descriptive name like "GPT-4o" or "Claude Sonnet" or "Local Llama"
   - This name appears when selecting which AI to use

   **Provider:**
   - Select the provider that matches your API key:
     - **OpenRouter** — For OpenRouter keys
     - **OpenAI** — For OpenAI keys or OpenAI-compatible services
     - **Anthropic** — For Anthropic/Claude keys
     - **Ollama** — For local Ollama
     - **Google** — For Google AI keys

   **API Key:**
   - Select the API key you added in Step 2
   - For Ollama, this field may not appear or can be left empty

   **Model:**
   - Choose which specific AI model to use
   - The dropdown shows available models for your provider
   - **Recommendations:**
     - OpenRouter: `anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet` or `openai/gpt-4o`
     - OpenAI: `gpt-4o` or `gpt-4o-mini` (cheaper)
     - Anthropic: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` or `claude-3-5-haiku-20241022` (cheaper)
     - Ollama: `llama3.2` or `mistral`

   **Base URL (for custom servers):**
   - Usually leave this empty (uses default)
   - For local OpenAI-compatible servers, enter your server URL
   - Example: `http://localhost:1234/v1` for LM Studio

4. **Save and Test**
   - Click **Save** to create the profile
   - Click **Test Connection** to verify it works
   - You should see a success message

5. **Set as Default (Optional)**
   - If this is your main profile, click **Set as Default**
   - New characters will use this profile automatically

> **Need more help?** See [Connection Profiles](connection-profiles.md) for detailed configuration options.

## Step 4: Set Up Embedding (For Memory Search)

Embeddings help Quilltap find relevant memories during conversations. When a character needs to remember something, embeddings help find the right information.

### Option A: Use Built-in TF-IDF (Recommended for Most Users)

Quilltap includes a built-in embedding system that works without any external services. **This is set up automatically on first run.**

**Check if it's working:**

1. Go to: the **Memory & Search** tab in Settings (`/settings?tab=memory`)
2. Look for a profile named "Built-in TF-IDF" or similar
3. It should show as the default (star icon)

**If no profile exists:**

1. Click **Add Profile** or **+ New Profile**
2. Select **BUILTIN** as the provider
3. Name it "Built-in TF-IDF"
4. Click **Save**
5. Click **Set as Default**

**Benefits of Built-in TF-IDF:**
- No API key required
- No additional cost
- Works offline
- Good enough for most use cases

---

### Option B: Use External Embedding Provider

For more sophisticated semantic search, you can use external embedding services. This is optional and adds cost.

**Using OpenAI Embeddings:**

1. Go to: the **Memory & Search** tab in Settings (`/settings?tab=memory`)
2. Click **Add Profile**
3. Select **OpenAI** as the provider
4. Select your OpenAI API key
5. Choose a model (e.g., `text-embedding-3-small`)
6. Save and optionally set as default

**Using OpenRouter Embeddings:**

Not all OpenRouter models support embeddings. Check OpenRouter's documentation for embedding-capable models.

> **Need more help?** See [Embedding Profiles](embedding-profiles.md) for detailed options.

---

## Step 5: Set Up a Cheap LLM (For Background Tasks)

Quilltap performs some tasks in the background, like:
- Extracting memories from conversations
- Generating chat titles
- Describing images
- Creating summaries

These don't need your most powerful (expensive) model. Setting up a "cheap LLM" saves money by using a faster, less expensive model for these tasks.

### Skip This Step If:
- You're using Ollama (all local, no cost difference)
- You don't mind using your main model for everything
- You want the simplest setup

### To Set Up a Cheap LLM:

1. **Create a Second Connection Profile**
   - Go to: **Settings** (`/settings?tab=providers`)
   - Create a new profile with a cheaper model:
     - OpenAI: `gpt-4o-mini` is much cheaper than `gpt-4o`
     - Anthropic: `claude-3-5-haiku` is cheaper than `claude-3-5-sonnet`
     - OpenRouter: Look for models with lower per-token costs
   - Name it something like "Cheap - GPT-4o-mini"

2. **Configure Chat Settings**
   - Go to: the **Chat** tab in Settings (`/settings?tab=chat`)
   - Find the **Cheap LLM** section
   - Toggle **Enable Cheap LLM** on
   - Select your cheaper profile from the dropdown

3. **Done!**
   - Background tasks now use the cheaper model
   - Your main profile is reserved for actual conversations

> **Need more help?** See [Chat Settings](chat-settings.md) for more options.

## Step 6: Start Your First Chat

You're ready to chat! Quilltap comes with a starter character, or you can create your own.

### Chat with the Default Character

1. **Go to Characters**
   - Click **Characters** in the left sidebar
   - Or go to: [Characters](/aurora)

2. **Find a Character**
   - You should see at least one character (often named "Ben" or similar)
   - Click on the character to view their profile

3. **Start a Chat**
   - Click the **Chat** button on the character card
   - Or click **New Chat** from the character's profile page

4. **Send Your First Message**
   - Type a message in the input box at the bottom
   - Press **Enter** or click **Send**
   - Wait for the character to respond

5. **Continue the Conversation**
   - Keep chatting!
   - The character will maintain their personality throughout

### Create Your Own Character

1. Go to: [Characters](/aurora)
2. Click **Create Character** or **+ New Character**
3. Fill in at least:
   - **Name** — What to call the character
   - **Description** — Who they are and their personality
4. Click **Create**
5. Start chatting with your new character!

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "No connection profile configured"

**Problem:** Character doesn't have a way to talk to an AI.

**Solution:**
1. Create a connection profile (Step 3 above)
2. Set it as default, OR
3. Go to the character's settings and assign a profile

---

### "API key invalid" or "Authentication failed"

**Problem:** Your API key isn't working.

**Solutions:**
- Double-check you copied the entire key (no missing characters)
- Make sure you selected the correct provider
- Verify the key hasn't been revoked or expired
- Check that you have credits/balance with the provider
- For OpenAI-compatible servers, verify the base URL is correct

---

### "Rate limit exceeded"

**Problem:** You've made too many requests too quickly.

**Solutions:**
- Wait a few minutes and try again
- Check your provider's rate limits
- Consider upgrading your plan for higher limits

---

### "Insufficient credits" or "Payment required"

**Problem:** Your account needs more funds.

**Solution:**
- Add credits to your provider account
- Check your usage dashboard for spending

---

### Ollama not connecting

**Problem:** Quilltap can't reach your local Ollama.

**Solutions:**
- Make sure Ollama is running (`ollama serve`)
- Check Ollama is on the default port (11434)
- Try accessing `http://localhost:11434` in your browser
- Restart Ollama if needed

> **Docker users:** If you're running Quilltap in Docker and Ollama on your host machine, you don't need to change the URL. Add `11434` to the `HOST_REDIRECT_PORTS` environment variable when starting the container, and `http://localhost:11434` works transparently. See the [Deployment Guide](/docs/DEPLOYMENT.md) for details.

---

### Character responses are slow

**Possible causes:**
- Large AI models take longer to respond
- Your internet connection (for cloud providers)
- Your computer's speed (for Ollama)

**Solutions:**
- Try a smaller/faster model
- Check your internet connection
- For Ollama, try a smaller model like `llama3.2:3b`

---

### Memories not working

**Problem:** Character doesn't remember past conversations.

**Solutions:**
- Check that an embedding profile is configured and set as default
- Verify the cheap LLM is configured (for memory extraction)
- Wait a moment — memory extraction happens in the background
- Check the Tasks Queue in **Settings** (`/settings?tab=system`) for any errors
