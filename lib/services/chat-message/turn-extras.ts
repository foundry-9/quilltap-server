/**
 * Turn Extras — the parts of an outgoing payload that are not context.
 *
 * The context builder produces the messages; the orchestrator then adds things
 * the builder never sees: the tool/function schemas (which ride beside the
 * message array entirely) and one or two system messages spliced in downstream
 * (agent-mode instructions, the tool-change notice).
 *
 * All of it counts against the model's context window, and none of it used to
 * count against the budget — the builder packed history right up to the ceiling
 * and the orchestrator then piled these on top, which is how a turn could clear
 * the budget and still exceed the window.
 *
 * **This module is the one place those additions are built and measured.**
 * Building them here and handing the *same strings* back to the splice sites is
 * the point: a reservation computed from separately-constructed text is a
 * reservation that drifts the first time either copy is edited.
