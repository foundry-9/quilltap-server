# The Book Remembers When and Where

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=memory)**

For the longest time, the Commonplace Book kept splendid notes on *what* happened and rather shabby ones on *when* and *where*. Ask a character "remember that place we visited last week?" and the poor thing was left rifling through undated pages — it might draw a blank, or worse, invent an answer with perfect confidence. No longer. The Book has taken up the habits of a proper diarist: every memory now carries the date the thing *happened* (not merely the date it was written down), the places and persons involved, and — for stories that keep their own calendar — the in-story hour as well.

## What Changed on the Shelves

- **Every memory is dated by the event.** A recollection formed today about last month's outing is filed under last month, where it belongs. When a character's memories are whispered into a conversation, each arrives with its age on its sleeve — *[3 days ago]*, *[last week]* — so the character can actually confirm "yes, last Tuesday" instead of guessing.
- **Outings become episodes.** A real excursion spans many turns of conversation, and used to survive only as scattered one-line fragments. Now, as the Librarian folds a chapter of your chat into the running summary, the Book composes a proper episode entry — a short, dated narrative of what happened, where, and with whom — and ties the fragments to it with ribbon. The running summary itself gains a dated **Timeline** of events, kept in every character's vault.
- **Two visits are two memories.** Previously, visiting the same harbor in spring and again in winter could collapse into a single confused entry. The Book now checks the dates before merging: same activity, different occasion — both are kept.
- **Old memories are not punished for being old — when you ask about old times.** Ordinarily the Book favors the fresh and the current. But the moment a conversation turns retrospective ("remember when…?"), it reverses course: memories of the past are *promoted*, the referenced time period is searched directly, and the usual courtesy of not repeating itself is suspended — because when you re-ask, you want the same memory found, not politely withheld.
- **A dated reading list, on demand.** On such retrospective turns the Book also produces a small extra whisper: the past conversations that cover the period in question, each with its date and a conversation ID the character can open with the `read_conversation` tool to reread the original scene.
- **Honest tools, honest answers.** Characters' `search` tool now accepts a time period (`since`/`until`) and a subject (`aboutCharacter`), returns each memory's event date and source conversation, and `read_conversation` can fetch just a slice of a long transcript. And the standing instruction is now written plainly into every character's orders: if the search turns up nothing, say you don't recall — never invent the particulars.

## Stories on Their Own Calendar

If your chat is a work of fiction that runs on its own clock — the third night at sea, the eve of the coronation — the Book can keep *that* calendar too. A chat may be set to **narrative** timeline mode (the default is **realtime**), in which case in-story time phrases are preserved alongside the wall-clock date and shown with each memory.

The switch lives in the Salon: open the chat sidebar, unfold the **Chat** card, and find **The Story's Clock**. *Real time* files memories by the calendar on the wall; *Story time* lets the narrative's own reckoning govern. Flip it whenever you please — the setting is per chat, takes effect on the next turn, and memories already on the shelves keep whatever dates they were filed under.

## For the Mechanically Inclined

The `quilltap recall-replay <chatId>` command (with the dev server running) replays any turn's memory recall and prints the full ranking table — old behavior and new, side by side — so you can see precisely why a given memory surfaced or sank. See the [CLI reference](cli-memories.md) for its sibling tools.
