# Quilltap Production Deployment Guide

## Overview

Quilltap uses **SQLite** for data storage and the **local filesystem** for files. SQLite is self-contained and requires no external database services. The Docker image is the recommended way to run Quilltap in production.

## Prerequisites

### Server Requirements

- **Operating System**: Any Linux distribution, macOS, or Windows with Docker support
- **RAM**: Minimum 2GB, recommended 4GB+
- **Storage**: Minimum 10GB SSD
- **CPU**: 2+ cores recommended
- **Docker**: Docker Engine 20.10+ or Docker Desktop

### Optional

- **Domain name** with DNS pointing to your server (for HTTPS)
- **Reverse proxy** (Nginx, Caddy, Traefik) for SSL termination

## Quick Start

### 1. Run the Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quilltap \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/quilltap \
  foundry9/quilltap
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` and you're running. On first launch, you'll be guided through a setup wizard that generates your encryption key automatically.

### 2. Production Configuration

For a production deployment, configure additional environment variables:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quilltap \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /home/quilltap/data:/app/quilltap \
  -e BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.com" \
  foundry9/quilltap
```

**CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES:**

1. **Backup the `.dbkey` file** — The encryption pepper is auto-generated on first run and stored in `data/quilltap.dbkey` inside your data directory. There is one key file per instance, and all three databases open with it. Without this file, your encrypted databases cannot be decrypted. Use a persistent volume so the key file survives container rebuilds.
2. **Optional passphrase protection** — You can protect the `.dbkey` file with a passphrase via the setup wizard or settings. If set, the passphrase is required on every startup (or after an auto-lock timeout). If the `.dbkey` file is lost and a passphrase was set, the database is unrecoverable.
3. **Auto-lock** — Passphrase-protected instances support an idle timer that automatically locks the database after a configurable period of inactivity, requiring the passphrase to resume.

## Environment Variables

### Production

Only needed when exposing Quilltap on a custom domain. For local use, everything has sensible defaults.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `BASE_URL` | Your production URL | `http://localhost:3000` |

### Networking

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QUILLTAP_HOST` | Address the server binds to. Outside Docker the default is loopback only; set `0.0.0.0` to listen on every interface (see [Network exposure](#network-exposure)). The CLI's `--host` flag sets it | `127.0.0.1` (`0.0.0.0` in the Docker image, via `HOSTNAME`) |
| `QUILLTAP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated host names the server answers to, besides loopback names, IP addresses and the host of `BASE_URL`. `*.example.com` matches subdomains | — |
| `QUILLTAP_HOST_IP` | Host gateway IP for localhost URL rewriting. Auto-detected in Docker; **required** to enable rewriting in a self-managed VM | Auto-detected in Docker |

### Network exposure

**Quilltap has no login.** It is a single-user application: anyone who can reach its port can read and change everything in it, run terminals, and install plugins. Treat the port as the boundary.

- **Bare metal / CLI:** the server listens on `127.0.0.1` only. To reach it from another machine, start it with `quilltap --host 0.0.0.0` (or `QUILLTAP_HOST=0.0.0.0`) and only do so on a network you trust.
- **Docker:** the image listens on `0.0.0.0` *inside* the container, and the port you publish with `-p` is the boundary. Prefer `-p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000` unless other machines need it.
- **Host names:** the server refuses requests addressed to a host name it does not recognise. Loopback names (`localhost`, `*.localhost`) and IP addresses always work; the host of `BASE_URL` is added automatically; add any other name (`nas.local`, a reverse proxy's domain) to `QUILLTAP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`.
- **Other sites:** API requests that a browser marks as coming from another site or origin are refused, and no CORS headers are sent.
- **Internet exposure:** put it behind a reverse proxy that adds authentication (HTTP basic auth, an SSO proxy, a VPN). TLS alone is not enough.

### Encryption

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_PEPPER` | Master encryption key (optional, auto-generated via /setup) | Auto-generated |

### Database

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SQLITE_PATH` | Path to SQLite database file | `/app/quilltap/data/quilltap.db` |
| `SQLITE_WAL_MODE` | Enable Write-Ahead Logging | `true` |
| `SQLITE_BUSY_TIMEOUT` | Max wait for database locks (ms) | `5000` |
| `SQLITE_FOREIGN_KEYS` | Enforce foreign keys; `false` turns enforcement off (diagnostics only) | `true` |
| `SQLITE_SYNCHRONOUS` | SQLite `synchronous` pragma (`OFF`, `NORMAL`, `FULL`, `EXTRA`) | SQLite's default for the journal mode |
| `SQLITE_CACHE_SIZE` | SQLite `cache_size` pragma: positive is pages, negative is KiB (e.g. `-131072` for 128 MiB) | SQLite's default |

### Cloud-synced data directories (macOS)

At startup Quilltap downloads any iCloud Drive / File Provider placeholders in the data directory before opening the database, so an evicted file is never read as empty.

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QUILLTAP_SKIP_CLOUD_MATERIALIZE` | Set to `1` to skip the placeholder download pass | (unset) |
| `QUILLTAP_CLOUD_MATERIALIZE_STALL_MS` | How long a single download may make no progress before it is given up (ms, minimum 1000) | `30000` |

### Timezone

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE` | IANA timezone name (e.g., `America/New_York`, `Europe/London`, `Asia/Tokyo`) for timestamp injection. Auto-detected in Electron app. | System default (usually UTC in Docker) |
| `TZ` | Standard Unix timezone for the process clock. Governs the paths that read local time directly rather than the formatting chain: episodic day-references ("today"/"yesterday" recall windows), the autonomous-room daily token budget rollover at local midnight, and croner schedule evaluation. | System default (UTC in Docker) |

Setting either one in Docker is enough: the container entrypoint copies whichever is present into the other, with `QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE` winning if both are set and disagree. No `tzdata` package is needed — Node resolves `TZ` through its bundled ICU.

Setting only one *outside* the entrypoint (a bare `node server.js`, say) leaves the two halves disagreeing: chat timestamps on your clock, schedules and recall windows on UTC.

**The startup scripts set this for you.** `scripts/start-quilltap.sh`, `scripts/start-quilltap.ps1`, and `npm run start:docker` detect the host's IANA timezone and pass it as `QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE`, so a container started through any of them follows your clock rather than UTC. Supplying your own value always wins:

```bash
./scripts/start-quilltap.sh -e "QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE=Europe/Paris"   # explicit zone
./scripts/start-quilltap.sh -e "QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE=UTC"            # pin to UTC
```

Each script prints what it resolved (`Timezone:  America/Chicago (detected)`), and falls back to UTC with a note if the host zone can't be determined. If you invoke `docker run` yourself, pass it explicitly:

```bash
docker run -d -e "QUILLTAP_TIMEZONE=$(node -p 'Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone')" foundry9/quilltap:latest
```

Use an IANA name, not an abbreviation — `America/Chicago`, not `CDT`. ICU can't resolve abbreviations and will silently fall back to UTC, so the scripts reject them rather than pass them through.

### Logging

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `LOG_LEVEL` | Logging level (`error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`) | `info` |
| `LOG_OUTPUT` | Where logs go (`console`, `file`, `both`) | `console` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Environment | `production` |

### Themes

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QTAP_OFFICIAL_REGISTRY_PUBLIC_KEY` | Ed25519 public key for the official theme registry; when set, a fresh install adds that registry as a trusted source. `QUILLTAP_OFFICIAL_REGISTRY_PUBLIC_KEY` is read as a fallback name | (empty: the official registry is not added as a source on first run) |

### Development

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `ELECTRON_DEV` | Any value marks the process as running under the Electron shell in development; recorded in the instance lock's environment type | (unset) |

### Plugins

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `SITE_PLUGINS_ENABLED` | Comma-separated plugin IDs, or `all` | `all` |
| `SITE_PLUGINS_DISABLED` | Comma-separated plugin IDs to disable | (empty) |

## Accessing Host Services (Ollama, LM Studio, etc.)

If you run local services on your host machine (Ollama, LM Studio, MCP servers), Quilltap automatically rewrites `localhost` and `127.0.0.1` URLs to point at the host gateway. This means you can configure `http://localhost:11434` in the UI and it will work transparently in Docker — no manual port forwarding needed.

On Linux, add `--add-host` so the container can resolve the host IP:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quilltap \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/quilltap \
  --add-host=host.docker.internal:host-gateway \
  foundry9/quilltap
```

On **macOS and Windows**, Docker Desktop provides `host.docker.internal` automatically — no extra flags needed.

### Override Host IP

If automatic detection doesn't work in your environment, set the `QUILLTAP_HOST_IP` environment variable to the IP address of your host machine:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name quilltap \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /path/to/data:/app/quilltap \
  -e QUILLTAP_HOST_IP="192.168.1.100" \
  foundry9/quilltap
```

In Docker this overrides `host.docker.internal`. In a **self-managed virtual machine** it is the only supported route: Quilltap cannot detect a hand-rolled VM, so `QUILLTAP_HOST_IP` both switches rewriting on and supplies the gateway address. Set it to whatever address inside the VM reaches your host's loopback.

## Reverse Proxy Setup

For production with HTTPS, put a reverse proxy in front of Quilltap. Quilltap has no login of its own, so the proxy should also authenticate (see [Network exposure](#network-exposure)). Set `BASE_URL` to the public URL (or list the domain in `QUILLTAP_ALLOWED_HOSTS`); otherwise requests forwarded with the public `Host` header are refused. Here are examples for common proxies:

### Nginx

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    client_max_body_size 10M;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
        proxy_read_timeout 300s;
    }
}

server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;
    return 301 https://$server_name$request_uri;
}
```

### Caddy

```
yourdomain.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:3000
}
```

Caddy handles SSL automatically via Let's Encrypt.

## Plugin Management

### npm-Installed Plugins in Docker

Plugins are stored in the data directory which is mounted from the host, so they persist across container restarts.

The volume mount includes the plugins directory:

```
/path/to/data/                   # Host data directory
├── data/                        # SQLite database
├── files/                       # User files
├── logs/                        # Application logs
└── plugins/
    └── npm/                     # npm-installed plugins
        ├── qtap-plugin-foo/
        │   └── node_modules/
        │       └── qtap-plugin-foo/
        │           └── manifest.json
        └── registry.json        # Tracks installed plugins
```

### Installing Plugins

Plugins can be installed via the Settings > Plugins page in the web UI, or via API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/api/v1/plugins?action=install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"packageName": "qtap-plugin-example"}'
```

After installing, restart the container to activate the plugin:

```bash
docker restart quilltap
```

## Data Management

Quilltap stores application data in two places:

1. **SQLite Database File** — All application data in a single file at `/app/quilltap/data/quilltap.db`
2. **File Storage** — Local filesystem for user files and images

### Storage Monitoring

```bash
# Check database file size
docker exec quilltap ls -lh /app/quilltap/data/quilltap.db

# Check database integrity
docker exec quilltap sqlite3 /app/quilltap/data/quilltap.db "PRAGMA integrity_check;"
```

## Monitoring

### Application Health Check

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
# Expected response: 200 OK
```

### Container Status

```bash
# View container status
docker ps --filter name=quilltap

# View logs
docker logs -f quilltap

# Monitor resource usage
docker stats quilltap
```

### Set Up Monitoring Alerts

```bash
# Using curl + cron to check health every 5 minutes
*/5 * * * * curl -f http://yourdomain.com/api/health || \
  mail -s "Quilltap health check failed" admin@yourdomain.com
```

## Backup Strategy

### Automated Daily Backups

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# /home/quilltap/backup-quilltap.sh

BACKUP_DIR="/home/quilltap/backups"
DATA_DIR="/home/quilltap/data"  # Your mounted data directory
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

mkdir -p "$BACKUP_DIR"

# Backup SQLite database (safe to copy while running due to WAL mode)
cp "$DATA_DIR/data/quilltap.db" "$BACKUP_DIR/quilltap_$TIMESTAMP.db"
tar -czf "$BACKUP_DIR/quilltap_$TIMESTAMP.db.tar.gz" \
  -C "$BACKUP_DIR" "quilltap_$TIMESTAMP.db"
rm "$BACKUP_DIR/quilltap_$TIMESTAMP.db"

# Keep only last 7 days
find "$BACKUP_DIR" -name "quilltap_*.db.tar.gz" -mtime +7 -delete

echo "$(date): Backup completed: $TIMESTAMP" >> "$BACKUP_DIR/backup.log"
```

Add to crontab:

```bash
crontab -e
# Add: 0 2 * * * /home/quilltap/backup-quilltap.sh
```

See [Backup & Restore Guide](BACKUP-RESTORE.md) for detailed procedures.

## Updating

### From Docker Hub

```bash
# Pull latest image
docker pull foundry9/quilltap:latest

# Stop and remove old container
docker stop quilltap
docker rm quilltap

# Start with new image (same arguments as before)
docker run -d \
  --name quilltap \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  -v /home/quilltap/data:/app/quilltap \
  -e BASE_URL="https://yourdomain.com" \
  foundry9/quilltap:latest

# Verify it's working
docker logs -f quilltap
curl https://yourdomain.com/api/health
```

### Rollback

```bash
# If something goes wrong, use the previous image tag
docker stop quilltap
docker rm quilltap
docker run -d --name quilltap ... foundry9/quilltap:previous-version
```

## Container Contents

The production image is built on [Wolfi](https://github.com/wolfi-dev)
(`cgr.dev/chainguard/wolfi-base`), a glibc distribution whose packages are rebuilt
continuously. It replaced `node:24-bookworm-slim` in 4.13 because every finding
left in the Debian image (util-linux, zlib, ncurses, systemd libraries, gzip, acl)
had no fix available, and Debian 13 scanned no better. Its package manager is
`apk`, not `apt-get`.

The image is deliberately minimal. Beyond Node.js and the application itself, it
ships only what a code path actually invokes:

| Present | Why |
| --- | --- |
| `node` | The container's only command (`node server.js`) |
| `bash` | Ariel's terminal — the PTY hard-codes `/bin/bash` |
| `zip`, `unzip` | Backup creation and restore shell out to these |
| `quilltap` | The CLI, for in-container debugging (`quilltap db --tables`) |

**Deliberately absent:** `npm`, `npx`, `corepack`, `yarn`, `perl`, `git`, `curl`,
`wget`, `jq`.

Each was removed to shrink the image's CVE surface, and none is on a code path:

- **npm / npx / corepack / yarn** are not installed (on Wolfi, npm is a separate
  package). Plugin installation does not use them — Quilltap downloads and
  extracts registry tarballs over HTTP directly, so Settings → Plugins and the
  install API work exactly as before.
- **perl** is not installed. Nothing in Quilltap invokes it; it used to arrive
  only as a dependency of `git`.
- **git / curl / wget / jq** were previously pre-installed as a convenience toolbox
  for the LLM shell agent. The `curl` **tool** your characters use is a plugin that
  makes HTTP requests from within Node, so it is unaffected. Only a human typing at
  Ariel's bash prompt loses these commands.

If your deployment genuinely needs one of them, layer it on top rather than
patching the base:

```dockerfile
FROM foundry9/quilltap:latest
USER root
RUN apk add --no-cache curl
USER nextjs
```

Be aware that you are reintroducing that package's vulnerabilities, and that
`git` in particular pulls `perl` in behind it.

Non-Docker installations are unaffected — they use whatever tools are already on
the host.

## Troubleshooting

### Application Won't Start

```bash
# Check logs
docker logs quilltap

# Common issues:
# - Port 3000 already in use
# - Pepper vault needs setup (navigate to /setup)
# - .env variables missing required values
# - SQLite database file not writable (check volume permissions)

# Check container is running
docker ps --filter name=quilltap
```

### Permission Issues

```bash
# If SQLite database isn't writable, check ownership
ls -la /path/to/data/data/

# The container runs as uid 1001 (nextjs user)
# Ensure your data directory is writable by uid 1001
sudo chown -R 1001:1001 /path/to/data/
```

### High Memory Usage

```bash
# Check memory usage
docker stats quilltap

# If high, restart the container
docker restart quilltap

# The default Node.js heap limit is 2048 MB (set via NODE_OPTIONS).
# To increase it, override at runtime:
docker run -e NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=4096" quilltap
```

### Data Not Persisting

```bash
# Verify volume mount is correct
docker inspect quilltap | grep -A 5 Mounts

# Check SQLite database contains data
docker exec quilltap sqlite3 /app/quilltap/data/quilltap.db "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
```
