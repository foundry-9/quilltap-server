# Changelog

All notable changes to @quilltap/plugin-utils will be documented in this file.

## [2.7.1] - 2026-10-13

Version-only republish of 2.7.0 (no code changes): 2.7.0 had not appeared on the registry yet when the plugins needed it.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-10-13

### Fixed

- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` now reports `usage.promptTokens` / `usage.totalTokens` with prompt-cache hits excluded, matching every other Quilltap provider. Endpoints fold cached input into `prompt_tokens` and report it as `prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`; that count is now subtracted (floored at 0) and surfaced as `cacheUsage` (`cacheReadInputTokens`, `cachedTokens`). The final stream chunk also carries the endpoint's own `usage` block as `rawProviderUsage`. Endpoints that report no cached tokens are unchanged. Previously, cache hits on any plugin built on the base class counted against Quilltap's autonomous-room token budgets.

### Added

- `protected normalizeUsage(usage)` — the one place both `sendMessage` and `streamMessage` map a Chat Completions `usage` block. Subclasses that keep the base send/stream loops can override it for an endpoint that reports cache hits in a different field.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-08-27

### Removed

- **Breaking (behavioral):** `rewriteLocalhostUrl` / `isVMEnvironment` no longer detect Lima or WSL2, and the gateway resolution no longer falls back to `/proc/net/route` or `/etc/hosts`. Quilltap has dropped its managed Lima (macOS) and WSL2 (Windows) VM modes; the supported sandbox is Docker, plus any virtual machine a user builds and manages themselves. Both of the removed fallbacks existed only to serve Lima: the `/proc/net/route` default gateway is the Docker bridge interface, which does *not* reach services on the host's loopback, and `/etc/hosts` can only report a `host.docker.internal` that strategy 2 already assumes.

### Changed

- `isVMEnvironment()` is now `isDockerEnvironment() || !!process.env.QUILLTAP_HOST_IP`. A hand-rolled VM cannot be auto-detected, so `QUILLTAP_HOST_IP` is what opts one in — it both enables rewriting and supplies the gateway address. Docker behavior is unchanged: `QUILLTAP_HOST_IP` first, else `host.docker.internal`.

## [2.5.0] - 2026-08-26

### Added

- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` gained a `protected buildRequestBody(params, stream)` — the one Chat Completions body build both `sendMessage` and `streamMessage` now call, replacing two byte-identical copies of the message mapping and body literal. Behavior-preserving: the streaming keys (`stream`, `stream_options`) keep their historical position between `stop` and `user`, so the serialized body is unchanged. Subclasses that keep the base send/stream loops get a single override point for reshaping the body.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-08-19

### Added

- `collapseLeadingSystemMessages(messages)` — folds a run of consecutive leading `system` messages into one, joining the contents with a blank line. Arrays with fewer than two leading system messages come back untouched (same reference).
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` gained `acceptsRepeatedSystemMessages` (default `true`, so every existing subclass is byte-identical on the wire) and applies it through `applySystemMessagePolicy` in both the streaming and non-streaming body builds. A subclass pointing at a local runtime sets it `false`: the model's own chat template is what runs there, and the Qwen family — plus several Llama- and Gemma-derived templates — `raise_exception` on any system message after index 0, rejecting the whole request. Quilltap emits up to three leading system blocks so its cache breakpoints survive, so every non-opening turn against such a model failed outright. (Quilltap bug 82.)

## [2.3.0] - 2026-08-15

### Added

- `applyProfileParameters(body, params, allowlist, normalize?)` — the one mechanism providers use to forward a connection profile's free-form `parameters` blob onto a request body. Allow-listed (never spread, so `model` / `messages` / `stream` / `tools` stay unreachable from a profile); `undefined`, `null` and the empty string omit the key. Exported as a free function rather than a base-class method because only one plugin extends `OpenAICompatibleProvider` — Z.AI, OpenRouter and Ollama implement their providers directly and reach it by composition.
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` gained `profileParamAllowlist` (empty by default, so every existing subclass is byte-identical on the wire until it opts in) and an overridable `normalizeProfileParam`, applied in both the streaming and non-streaming body builds.
- `OpenAICompatibleProvider` now sends `tools` / `tool_choice` when the caller supplies tools, and parses `tool_calls` back — from `choice.message.tool_calls` on the non-streaming path, and by accumulating index-keyed `delta.tool_calls` fragments while streaming. Previously it could never call a tool.

## [2.2.19] - 2026-08-03

### Fixed

- `PLUGIN_UTILS_VERSION` no longer drifts from the published version. The constant was a hand-written literal and had been stale since 2.2.1 while the package shipped 2.2.18, so any consumer using it for a runtime compatibility check got a wrong answer. It is now generated into `src/version.generated.ts` from the `version` field in package.json by `scripts/generate-version.mjs`, which runs from `prebuild` and `pretypecheck` — bumping package.json is the only step. Both the runtime value and the literal type in `dist/index.d.ts` follow automatically.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-04-09

### Removed

- **Breaking:** Removed roleplay template utilities from main exports — `createRoleplayTemplatePlugin`, `createSingleTemplatePlugin`, `validateTemplateConfig`, `validateRoleplayTemplatePlugin` are no longer exported
- Removed `./roleplay-templates` export path from package.json
- Roleplay templates are now native first-class entities in Quilltap v4.2.0, no plugin needed
- Updated `@quilltap/plugin-types` dependency to `^2.2.0`

## [1.4.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

  - Self-contained environment detection (no dependency on Quilltap core `lib/paths`)

## [1.3.0] - 2026-01-30

### Added

- **Built-in Tool Names for Collision Detection**
  - Added `BUILTIN_TOOL_NAMES` constant with names of Quilltap's built-in tools
  - Added `getBuiltinToolNames()` function for dynamic access to the set
  - Enables plugins (like MCP connectors) to avoid shadowing built-in functionality
  - Built-in tools: `generate_image`, `search_memories`, `search_web`, `project_info`, `file_management`, `request_full_context`

## [1.2.5] - 2026-01-25

### Fixed

- **Environment Variable Typo**
  - Fixed spelling of environment variable from QUIL-T-T-AP to QUIL-L-T-AP (correct: `QUILLTAP_LOG_LEVEL`)
- **Unused Variable Cleanup**
  - Removed unused `finalFinishReason` variable in OpenAI-compatible provider streaming
  - Removed unused `enableLogging` functionality in roleplay template builder (option retained in API for future use)

## [1.2.4] - 2026-01-21

### Fixed

- **Graceful Handling of Incomplete Tool Call Arguments During Streaming**
  - `parseOpenAIToolCalls()` now checks if JSON arguments look complete before parsing
  - Skips tool calls with incomplete JSON (common during streaming) instead of throwing errors
  - Eliminates noisy "Unterminated string in JSON" errors during streaming tool calls
  - Tool calls are correctly parsed when the final complete response is received

## [1.2.2] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed

- **Tool Call Parsing for Streaming Responses**
  - `parseOpenAIToolCalls()` now checks `choices[0].delta.toolCalls` for streaming responses (OpenRouter SDK uses this structure)
  - Added support for camelCase `toolCalls` in addition to snake_case `tool_calls` (SDK format varies)
  - `detectToolCallFormat()` updated to detect tool calls in delta for streaming responses
