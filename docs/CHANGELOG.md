#### Docs: design spec for character kind and roleplay defaults

- New `docs/developer/features/character-kind-and-roleplay-defaults.md`. Proposed, not implemented.
- Diagnosis: in two Friday chats (2026-11-03) every LLM character met an armed intruder with calm negotiation. Request logs trace it to companion-framed stock prompts, anti-escalation governors in the DeepSeek and MODERN General prompts, absolute temperament rules in generated prompts, assistant-style Agent Mode and tool-rule text, a fact-only inform header, and group scenes converging on one stance.
- Plan: a per-character `kind` (`roleplay` default, or `assistant`) read through one resolver; two Agent Mode flavours (research, in-character); a kind-aware tool-rules preamble; new MODERN Roleplay and MODERN Assistant sample prompts; a stakes direction for every prompt generator; a group-scene bullet against converging on one stance.
- Decisions recorded: the inform header is reworded to cover feeling and resolve (D2), and MODERN General is retired with a guarded prune of built-in prompt rows that are no longer shipped (D1).
