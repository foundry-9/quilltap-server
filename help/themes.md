# Themes

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/settings?tab=appearance&section=appearance)**

Themes control the overall look and feel of Quilltap, including colors, fonts, and visual styling. You can switch between the built-in default theme and custom themes installed as plugins or `.qtap-theme` bundles, and customize your preferred color mode (light, dark, or system).

## What Are Themes?

A theme is a complete visual design for Quilltap that includes:

- **Color scheme** — Primary, secondary, accent, and background colors for light and dark modes
- **Typography** — Font families used for headings and body text
- **Component styles** — Visual appearance of buttons, cards, inputs, and other UI elements
- **Dark mode support** — Some themes provide separate styling for light and dark modes

Quilltap comes with a built-in default theme and can be extended with custom themes installed as plugins or uploaded as `.qtap-theme` bundles.

## Available Themes

### Default Theme

Quilltap includes a carefully designed default theme featuring:

- A clean, professional color palette
- Excellent readability in both light and dark modes
- Consistent component styling
- Optimized for creative work and long writing sessions

The default theme is always available and serves as a fallback if no other theme is selected.

### Plugin Themes

Additional themes can be installed as plugins to provide alternative visual styles:

- Custom color palettes and design languages
- Specialized fonts and typography
- Themed components
- Additional customization options

Check your installed plugins to see available themes.

### Theme Bundles (.qtap-theme)

Theme bundles are a simpler way to distribute and install themes. A `.qtap-theme` file is a zip archive containing:

- **theme.json** — Theme manifest with metadata and design tokens
- **CSS files** — Optional style overrides
- **Font files** — Custom fonts (.woff2, .ttf, etc.)
- **Image assets** — Preview images and other assets

Theme bundles require no build tools, npm packages, or JavaScript code -- they are purely declarative, containing only static assets and configuration.

#### Installing a Theme Bundle

1. Open **Settings** from the sidebar
2. Go to the **Appearance** tab
3. Click the **Install Theme** button
4. Select a `.qtap-theme` file from your computer
5. The theme appears in your theme list immediately

#### Uninstalling a Theme Bundle

Bundle themes can be uninstalled from the Appearance settings:

1. Find the bundle theme in your theme list (marked with a "Bundle" badge)
2. Expand its preview
3. Click the trash icon to uninstall
4. The theme is removed from your system

Note: Plugin themes and the built-in default theme cannot be uninstalled from this interface.

#### Exporting a Theme

Any installed theme (including plugin themes and the default) can be exported as a `.qtap-theme` bundle:

1. Find the theme in your theme list
2. Expand its preview
3. Click the download/export icon
4. Save the `.qtap-theme` file to your computer
5. Share it with others or use it as a starting point for a new theme

## Color Modes

In addition to choosing a theme, you can select your preferred **color mode**:

### Light Mode

- Bright background with dark text
- Better for well-lit environments
- Reduces eye strain in daylight
- Use when you prefer a clean, bright interface

### Dark Mode

- Dark background with light text
- Better for low-light environments
- Reduces blue light exposure
- Use when you prefer a darker interface for evening work

### System Mode

- Automatically matches your operating system preference
- Switches when your OS switches between light and dark
- No manual switching needed
- Recommended for most users

## Understanding Your Theme

### Color Scheme

Each theme includes colors for:

- **Background** — The main background color for pages and components
- **Foreground** — Text and primary content color
- **Primary** — Accent color for important UI elements, buttons, links
- **Secondary** — Additional accent color for supporting elements
- **Accent** — Highlight color for special elements
- **Muted** — Subtle colors for borders, dividers, and less important content
- **Destructive** — Warning/danger color for actions like delete
- **Success, Warning, Info** — Semantic colors for feedback messages

### Light and Dark Mode Support

Themes provide colors for both modes:

- **Light mode colors** — Optimized for bright backgrounds
- **Dark mode colors** — Optimized for dark backgrounds

When you switch your color mode, the same theme's colors for that mode apply automatically.

### Typography

Themes specify:

- **Heading font** — For titles and section headers
- **Body font** — For regular text and content
- **Monospace font** — For code and technical text

Custom fonts are loaded automatically when you select a theme.

## Color Modes Explained

### System Mode (Recommended)

- **What it does** — Follows your computer's light/dark preference
- **When to use** — Most of the time; best for automatic consistency
- **How it works** — Quilltap detects your OS preference and switches automatically
- **Mobile** — Most phones default to light mode during day, dark at night

### Light Mode

- **When to use** — During daytime or in well-lit environments
- **Advantages** — Bright, clear interface; reduced eye strain in daylight
- **Note** — May cause glare on dark screens or in dim lighting

### Dark Mode

- **When to use** — At night or in low-light environments
- **Advantages** — Reduced blue light; comfortable for evening use
- **Note** — Some users prefer it all the time for comfort

## Custom Themes

### Installing Theme Plugins (Deprecated)

> **Note:** npm-based theme plugins are deprecated. We recommend using `.qtap-theme` bundles instead — they require no build tools or npm packages.

Custom themes were historically distributed as npm packages. Existing plugin themes still work, but new themes should use the bundle format. Plugin themes are marked with a "(deprecated)" badge in the theme selector.

### Installing Theme Bundles

The simplest way to install a custom theme:

1. Obtain a `.qtap-theme` file
2. Open **Settings** > **Appearance**
3. Click **Install Theme** and select the file
4. The theme is instantly available

### Creating Your Own Theme

The recommended way to create a theme is the `.qtap-theme` bundle format:

```bash
npx create-quilltap-theme my-theme
```

This scaffolds a directory with `theme.json`, `tokens.json`, `styles.css`, and a `fonts/` folder — no build tools, no npm packages, no TypeScript. Just edit JSON and CSS, then zip and install.

For the legacy npm plugin format (deprecated), use:

```bash
npx create-quilltap-theme my-theme --plugin
```

See the **Theme Plugin Development Guide** for details on the plugin format.

### Managing Themes via CLI

The `quilltap themes` CLI provides commands for managing theme bundles from the terminal:

```bash
# List all installed themes (default, plugins, bundles)
npx quilltap themes list

# Validate a .qtap-theme file before installing
npx quilltap themes validate my-theme.qtap-theme

# Install a .qtap-theme bundle
npx quilltap themes install my-theme.qtap-theme

# Install from a URL
npx quilltap themes install https://example.com/my-theme.qtap-theme

# Uninstall a bundle theme
npx quilltap themes uninstall my-theme

# Export any theme as a .qtap-theme file
npx quilltap themes export earl-grey --output ./my-export.qtap-theme

# Scaffold a new theme (delegates to create-quilltap-theme)
npx quilltap themes create sunset
```

The `validate` command checks bundle structure, file types, size limits, and manifest schema without installing. Use it to verify your bundle before distributing it.

### Theme Registries

Theme registries are remote indexes of themes that you can browse, search, and install from. Think of them as curated theme catalogs.

#### Browsing Themes in the UI

1. Open **Settings** > **Appearance**
2. Scroll down to the **Browse Themes** section
3. Search for themes by name, tag, or description
4. Click **Install** on any theme to download and install it
5. Verified themes show a checkmark badge (signature verified against the registry's public key)

#### Managing Registries via CLI

```bash
# List configured registries
npx quilltap themes registry list

# Add a registry source
npx quilltap themes registry add https://example.com/registry.json --name "My Registry"

# Add a registry with signature verification
npx quilltap themes registry add https://example.com/registry.json --key ed25519:BASE64KEY

# Remove a registry
npx quilltap themes registry remove "My Registry"

# Refresh all registry indexes
npx quilltap themes registry refresh

# Search for themes across registries
npx quilltap themes search "dark modern"

# Check for theme updates
npx quilltap themes update

# Update a specific theme
npx quilltap themes update my-theme
```

#### For Registry Operators

If you host your own theme registry, the CLI provides tools for signing:

```bash
# Generate an Ed25519 keypair
npx quilltap themes registry keygen --output ./keys

# Sign a registry directory
npx quilltap themes registry sign ./my-registry --key ed25519:PRIVATE_KEY
```

Registry indexes are JSON files listing available themes with download URLs, SHA-256 hashes, and optional Ed25519 signatures for integrity verification.

## Tips for Theme Selection

1. **Try different themes** — Spend time with each to find your favorite
2. **Consider color mode** — Choose light for daytime, dark for evening, system for automatic
3. **Test readability** — Make sure text is easy to read in your preferred theme
4. **Match your workflow** — Some themes may feel better for different types of work
5. **Use quick-switcher** — Enable it if you like switching themes frequently
6. **Adjust sidebar width** — Combined with theme changes, this can transform your interface

## Theme Persistence

Your theme choices are saved automatically:

- **Theme preference** — Your selected theme is remembered
- **Color mode preference** — Light/dark/system choice is saved
- **Quick-switcher setting** — Whether it's enabled is remembered
- **Cross-device** — Preferences sync across devices when logged in

Every time you log in, Quilltap remembers your theme selections.

## Troubleshooting Themes

### Theme Not Appearing

- Ensure the theme plugin is installed
- Try refreshing the browser
- Check that the plugin is enabled in your system
- Look in Settings → Plugins to verify installation

### Colors Look Wrong

- Check your color mode (light/dark/system)
- Verify you've selected the theme you want
- Try switching to system mode
- Check if a browser extension is interfering

### Fonts Look Different

- Custom fonts take a moment to load
- If fonts don't appear, the fallback font is used
- Refresh if needed
- Check your browser's font rendering settings

### Theme Doesn't Save

- Check your internet connection
- Verify you're logged in
- Try switching themes again
- Check the browser console for errors
