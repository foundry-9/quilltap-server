          A conversation left to gather dust accumulates a surprising amount of behind-the-scenes
          paraphernalia — compression caches, pre-rendered pages, the models&rsquo; own scratch-work.
          Once a chat has gone this many days without anyone actually speaking in it, Quilltap&rsquo;s
          nightly housekeeping quietly tidies that working data away. The conversation itself — every
          word anyone said — remains exactly as you left it, and the tidied bits are rebuilt the
          moment you take up the thread again.
