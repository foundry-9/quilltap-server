### Viewing Available Themes

In the Theme Selection section, you'll see:

- **Theme cards** — Each theme displayed in a grid
- **Color preview** — Sample colors for each theme
- **Theme name** — What to call the theme
- **Description** — What makes this theme unique
- **Dark mode badge** — Whether the theme supports dark mode
- **Active indicator** — A checkmark on the current theme

### Selecting a Theme

2. Click on a theme card to select it
3. The checkmark moves to show the new selection
4. Your interface updates instantly with the new theme
5. Your choice is saved automatically

5. Click to collapse again

### Installing More Themes

2. Search for theme plugins
3. Install the ones you like
4. New themes appear in Appearance → Theme Selection
5. Refresh if needed to see newly installed themes

## Color Mode Selection

### What are Color Modes?

Color modes determine whether Quilltap uses light or dark styling:

- **Light Mode** — Bright backgrounds, dark text (daytime use)
- **Dark Mode** — Dark backgrounds, light text (nighttime use)
- **System** — Automatically matches your computer's setting

### Available Modes

Below the theme cards, you'll see three color mode options:

- **☀ Light** — Always use light colors
- **☀ Dark** — Always use dark colors
- **◐ System** — Follow OS preference (recommended)

### Choosing a Color Mode

1. Find the color mode section
2. Click the radio button or option for your preference
3. The checkmark shows the current selection
4. Your interface updates instantly
5. Your choice is saved automatically

### System Mode (Recommended)

System mode is recommended because it:

- **Automatically switches** when your OS switches between light/dark
- **Reduces manual switching** — You don't need to remember to change it
- **Matches your environment** — Light during day, dark at night (on most systems)
- **Consistent** — Same as your other applications

### Manual Modes

Choose Light or Dark mode manually if you:

- **Always prefer one mode** — Regardless of time of day
- **Don't want automatic switching** — Want consistent appearance
- **Have custom OS settings** — Your OS doesn't switch automatically

## Theme Quick-Switcher

### What is the Quick-Switcher?

The quick-switcher is an optional button in your sidebar footer that gives you instant access to switch themes and color modes without opening Settings.

### Enabling the Quick-Switcher

1. Find the option **Show theme selector in navigation**
2. Toggle it to **ON**
3. A palette icon appears in your sidebar footer
4. Click it anytime to switch themes or color modes

### Disabling the Quick-Switcher

1. Find the option **Show theme selector in navigation**
2. Toggle it to **OFF**
3. The palette icon disappears from the sidebar
4. You can still change themes in Settings

### When to Enable It

Enable the quick-switcher if you:

- Frequently switch between themes
- Like quick access without opening Settings
- Have space in your sidebar
- Want instant theme previews

### When to Disable It

Disable it if you:

- Rarely switch themes
- Prefer the Settings interface
- Want a minimal sidebar
- Don't need quick access

See the [Theme Quick-Switcher help file](theme-quick-switcher.md) for detailed instructions.

## Sidebar Width Control

### Current Width Display

The sidebar width control shows:

- **Current width** — The current sidebar width in pixels (e.g., "280px")
- **Visual indicator** — Shows your width compared to default
- **Reset button** — Restore the default width if needed

### Adjusting Width

You can adjust sidebar width in two ways:

#### Method 1: Drag the Resize Handle

1. Position your cursor at the right edge of the sidebar
2. The cursor changes to a resize cursor (↔)
3. Drag left or right to adjust width
4. Your preference is saved automatically

#### Method 2: Via Settings

1. In Appearance settings, find the sidebar width section
2. See your current width
3. Click the "Reset" button to restore default width (if you've customized it)
4. Or use the drag method for precise control

### Minimum and Maximum Widths

- **Minimum** — Around 200px (keeps content readable)
- **Maximum** — Adjustable based on your screen size
- **Default** — Optimized for most use cases

### Why Adjust Width?

Adjust your sidebar width to:

- **Add more space** — Make sidebar wider for easier reading
- **See more content** — Narrow sidebar to view more main content
- **Fit your screen** — Adapt to different screen sizes
- **Customize layout** — Match your personal workflow

### Resetting to Default

1. Find the sidebar width section in Appearance settings
2. Click **Reset to Default** (if available)
3. Your sidebar returns to standard width
4. Other settings unchanged

## Layout Display Options

### What This Section Shows

The layout section may display:

- **Current sidebar width** — Your selected width
- **Collapse button location** — Where sidebar collapse button is
- **Responsive indicators** — How layout adapts to screen size
- **Visual preview** — How your current layout looks

### Sidebar Collapse

Your sidebar can be collapsed to show only icons:

1. Look for the collapse button at the top of the sidebar
2. Click to toggle between expanded and collapsed modes
3. Collapsed mode saves space for main content
4. Icons show labels on hover
5. Your collapse preference is saved

## Debug and Development Features

### Development Settings (if visible)

Some installations may show debug features:

- **Theme state display** — Current theme information
- **CSS variable testing** — Visual test of theme colors
- **Configuration details** — Technical theme information

These are useful for developers and are usually hidden in production.

## Preferences Are Saved Automatically

All Appearance settings are saved automatically:

- **Theme choice** — Your selected theme
- **Color mode** — Light/dark/system preference
- **Quick-switcher state** — Enabled or disabled
- **Sidebar width** — Your custom width
- **Collapse state** — Expanded or collapsed sidebar

Your preferences persist across sessions when logged in.

## How Appearance Settings Work Together

### Theme + Color Mode

The combination works as:

1. **Select a theme** — Defines colors, fonts, component styles
2. **Select a color mode** — Determines if those colors are light or dark
3. **Both apply together** — Theme provides the design, color mode applies it

For example:

- Earl Grey theme + Light mode = Earl Grey theme's light color palette
- Earl Grey theme + Dark mode = Earl Grey theme's dark color palette
- Same theme, different modes = Different appearance

### Quick-Switcher + Settings

- **Settings** — Full control and information
- **Quick-Switcher** — Faster switching without opening Settings
- **Both ways work** — Changes in one are reflected in the other
- **Choose your method** — Use whichever fits your workflow
