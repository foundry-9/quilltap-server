/**
 * Shared Wardrobe — read/ensure helpers for the `Wardrobe/` folder of an
 * arbitrary mount point.
 *
 * Every shared wardrobe tier is the same thing wearing a different hat: a
 * `Wardrobe/` folder in some mount, holding items nobody owns
 * (`characterId: null`). Quilltap General is the instance-wide one, a project
 * store is the project-wide one, a group's official store is the group-wide
 * one. This module is that one shape; `general-wardrobe.ts`,
 * `project-wardrobe.ts` and `group-wardrobe.ts` are thin scoped façades over it.
 *
 * The underlying reader (`readCharacterVaultWardrobe`) is already generic over
 * any mount point, so no new parsing is introduced here.
 *
 * @module mount-index/shared-wardrobe

 * Archetype seeding is disabled in the underlying reader: a shared composite
 * resolves its components within this same folder, not by recursing through

 * A shared composite whose components live in a *different* tier keeps those
 * refs as the UUIDs they were written as — `resolveAndCheckComponentItems`
 * only drops an unmatched *slug* (bug 187). Resolution against the other tiers
 * happens downstream (`expandComposites` tolerates unknown ids; read-time
