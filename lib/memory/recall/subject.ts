/**
 * Memory subject resolution.
 *
 * A character's memory store is keyed on `characterId` alone. It holds what
 * they remember about themselves and what they remember about everyone else
 * side by side, and `aboutCharacterId` is the only thing that separates the
 * two. The self-facing context blocks — `## Memory Anchors`, `## Relevant
 * Memories`, `Most relevant memories for this turn:` — arrive under a
 * second-person heading, so every line about someone else has to name its
 * subject or it reads as the character's own life (bug 122).
 *
 * This module is the one place that turns a pool of memories into the
 * {@link MemorySubjectContext} those formatters need. It lives here rather
 * than in `render.ts` so that module stays pure formatting with no
 * repository reach.

/**
 * Resolve the display names of every other character a pool of memories is
 * about, and pair them with the owning character.
 *
 * Only ids that are neither absent nor the character's own are looked up, so a
 * store of purely first-person memories costs no query at all. The lookup goes
 * through `findNamesByIds`, which skips the vault overlay and returns an empty
 * map on failure — a missing name degrades one line's prefix to
 * `About another character:` rather than taking the turn down with it.
