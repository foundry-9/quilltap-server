The name should be:
- Appropriate to the setting (fantasy, modern, sci-fi, etc.)
- Easy to pronounce and remember
- Evocative of the character's nature or background

Respond with ONLY the name, no quotes or explanation.`,

  title: `Generate a short, evocative title or epithet for this character (2-5 words).
Examples: "The Wandering Scholar", "Knight of the Fallen Star", "Last of the Old Guard"

Respond with ONLY the title, no quotes or explanation.`,

  identity: `${FIELD_SEMANTICS_PREAMBLE}

Write the IDENTITY field for this character: 1-2 short paragraphs of public-knowledge / outside-view facts only — name, station, occupation, public reputation, signifying outward facts a stranger could plausibly know without having spoken to the character.

Strict rules:
- Never include internal motivation, beliefs, or self-knowledge (those belong in PERSONALITY).
- Never include private mannerisms, verbal tics, or behaviour someone has to be acquainted with the character to notice (those belong in DESCRIPTION).
- Never include physical appearance — that lives in physicalDescriptions and is generated separately.

Write in third person, present tense.`,

  description: `${FIELD_SEMANTICS_PREAMBLE}

Write the DESCRIPTION field for this character: 1-2 short paragraphs of what someone who has interacted with the character would notice — behaviour, mannerisms, frequent verbal patterns, conversational tics, the way they handle themselves around others.

Strict rules:
- Do NOT describe physical appearance. Physical appearance lives in physicalDescriptions and is generated separately. If a visual reference has been provided, ignore it for this field.
- Do NOT restate the public-facing reputation that already belongs in IDENTITY.
- Do NOT write the character's private inner monologue or self-knowledge — that belongs in PERSONALITY.

Write in third person, present tense. Be vivid and specific about behaviour, not appearance.`,

  personality: `${FIELD_SEMANTICS_PREAMBLE}

Write the PERSONALITY field for this character: 1-2 short paragraphs of the character's own self-knowledge — the inner drivers of speech and behaviour, motivations, beliefs, emotional tendencies, the things only the character knows about themselves unless they choose to share them.

Strict rules:
- Never put outward behaviour someone else would observe here (that belongs in DESCRIPTION).
- Never put public-facing identity facts here (those belong in IDENTITY).
- Never describe physical appearance.

Write as instructions for how the character behaves on the inside, not as a story.`,

  scenarios: `Generate 2-3 distinct scenarios for interactions with this character. Each scenario should have a short title and detailed content. Return as a JSON array: [{"title": "...", "content": "..."}]

A scenario is a setting for a chat — it describes the environment, location, circumstances, and context in which an interaction with this character takes place. Scenarios set the stage but should NOT fundamentally change the character's personality, voice, or core behavior. Think of each scenario as a different "where and when" for encountering the character, not a different version of who they are.

Each scenario should:
- Describe a distinct setting, location, or situation where the character might be encountered
- Include details about the physical environment and atmosphere
- Include the relationship context between the character and the person they're interacting with
- Include any ongoing circumstances or events relevant to that setting
- Be written in present tense, setting the scene for roleplay
- Focus on the environment and situation, not on changing how the character behaves (the character's personality remains consistent across scenarios unless the environment naturally warrants different behavior)`,

  exampleDialogues: `Write 2-3 example dialogue exchanges that demonstrate this character's voice and personality.

Format each exchange as:
{{char}}: [Character's dialogue and actions]
{{user}}: [User's response]
{{char}}: [Character's follow-up]

Show variety in the character's emotional range and speech patterns. Include *actions* and *expressions* in asterisks.`,

  systemPrompt: `Write a system prompt that instructs an AI how to roleplay as this character. This will serve as the default system prompt (characters can have multiple named system prompts for different interaction styles, but this one should be a comprehensive general-purpose default).

Include:
- Core identity and self-perception
- Speech patterns and vocabulary
- Key behaviors and reactions
- Important boundaries or limitations
- Relationship dynamics to maintain

Write as direct instructions to the AI, in second person ("You are...", "You always...").
Keep it under 500 words but comprehensive.`,

A single item can cover multiple slots — for example, a full-length dress would have types ["top", "bottom"].
