/**
 * Query-key factory — the single source of truth for TanStack Query cache
 * identity.
 *
 * RULE: components and hooks must NEVER pass raw string/array keys to
 * `useQuery`/`invalidateQueries`. Always go through `queryKeys`. This is what
 * makes targeted, prefix-based invalidation reliable instead of brittle
 * URL string-matching — e.g. `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.characters.all })`
 * invalidates every list and detail under `['characters']`.
 *
 * Convention per entity:
 *   all:    the broadest prefix — invalidate this to refetch everything for the entity.
 *   list:   a (optionally filtered) collection read. Filters are folded into the
 *           key so distinct filter sets cache independently.
 *   detail: a single record by id.
 *   <sub>:  nested sub-resources hang under the parent id so they invalidate with it.
 *
 * This factory starts with the central entities and GROWS PER PHASE as each
 * migration batch moves its reads onto TanStack Query. Add a block when you
 * migrate an entity; do not scatter ad-hoc keys at call sites.
