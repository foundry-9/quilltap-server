### 4.12.1

#### Fixed: dated searches look at the period first, and an empty search says what it means

- A `search` with `since`/`until` (and a retrospective turn's recall) now reads the period's memories by event time in SQL (`MemoriesRepository.findIdsInEventWindow`) and scores them through the same index restricted to those ids (`memoryIndex.search` `includeIds`), so they join the candidate pool before the cut. Previously the window was applied to a pool already chosen from all time, so a dated question about a recurring place returned nothing. New `HitSource` `'window'`; the `gather` trace stage records `window` / `windowAdded`.
- On the tool path, a window of 14 days or less (`TOOL_WINDOW_FLOOR_MAX_DAYS`) is its own relevance filter: in-window memories and conversation chunks skip the cosine floor. Wider windows and the per-turn prompt path keep the floor.
- Conversation search takes `chatIds`; with a window, the tool restricts the chunk search to the period's chats (`findChatsInWindow`, `lib/scriptorium/chat-window.ts`) instead of filtering the all-time top-K afterwards. A chat's span is `createdAt` to `lastMessageAt`, not `updatedAt`. `searchConversationChunks` now honours an explicit `minScore: 0`.
- When `since`/`until` is given and `sources` is omitted, only memories and conversations are searched (conversations alone on the Brahma Console).
- The tool result carries a `windowCensus` (memories dated in the window, the conversations the character took part in during it, the current chat left out). An empty result now says whether nothing matched the words or nothing happened in the period, and names the period's conversations; non-empty dated results gain a footer listing them.
- Standing tool instructions (native and simple-JSON) now tell the character to read a listed conversation before saying it does not recall.
- The retrospective mini-recap lists in-window chats that have no vault summary yet, from the `chats` table. `VaultConversationMatch.relativePath` is now nullable.
- Undated searches and turns without a resolved time window are unchanged. No schema or export change.
- Spec: `docs/developer/features/complete/search-window-first-and-honest-empty.md`.
