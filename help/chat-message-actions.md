# Message Actions

> **[Open this page in Quilltap](/salon)**

Message actions are the tools available for managing individual messages in your chats. They let you edit, regenerate, delete, and otherwise modify messages to shape your conversations.

## Overview of Message Actions

Every message in a chat has actions you can perform. The available actions depend on:

- **Message Type** — Your messages vs. character messages
- **Chat Type** — Single-character vs. multi-character
- **Message State** — Normal, edited, part of a swipe group

## Accessing Message Actions

### Hover Actions

Most message actions appear when you hover over a message:

1. Move your mouse over a message
2. Action buttons appear (usually in the corner)
3. Click the desired action
4. Or click the **more options** menu (three dots) for additional actions

### Context Menu

Right-click a message for a context menu with all available actions.

### Touch Devices

On touch devices:

1. Long-press the message
2. Action menu appears
3. Tap the desired action

## Actions for Your Messages

### Edit Your Message

Modify what you said:

1. Hover over your message
2. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
3. Message text becomes editable
4. Make your changes
5. Click **Save** to confirm or **Cancel** to discard

**What happens:**
- Your edited message replaces the original
- Timestamp and metadata preserved
- If a character already responded, their response remains unchanged

**Use cases:**
- Fix typos or errors
- Clarify what you meant
- Add forgotten details

### Delete Your Message

Remove your message from the conversation:

1. Hover over your message
2. Click **Delete** (trash icon)
3. Confirm the deletion

**What happens:**
- Message is permanently removed
- Any response that followed may become orphaned
- Cannot be undone

**Memory handling:**
If your message triggered memory extraction:

- You may be asked about associated memories
- Choose to delete memories with the message or keep them
- See [Memory Cascade](#memory-cascade-on-deletion) for details

### Resend Your Message

Send the same message again:

1. Hover over your message
2. Click **Resend** (arrow icon)
3. Message is copied to input field
4. Optionally modify before sending
5. Press Enter to send

**What happens:**
- Original message remains
- You can edit before resending
- Useful for trying different phrasings

**Special behavior:**
- If there's a blank/failed response after the original, it may be removed
- Helps recover from failed generations

## Actions for Character Messages

### Generate Swipe (Regenerate)

Get an alternative response:

1. Hover over the character's message
2. Click **Regenerate** or **Swipe** (refresh icon)
3. Character generates a new response
4. New response appears, original is saved

**Swipe navigation:**
- Arrow buttons appear to navigate between versions
- All alternatives are kept
- Switch freely between swipes
- Current swipe position shown (e.g., "2 of 3")

**What happens:**
- AI generates fresh response to the same context
- Original response saved in swipe group
- Token usage counts for each generation

**Use cases:**
- Response doesn't fit the character
- Want to see different approaches
- Response quality was poor
- Looking for the perfect reaction

### Navigate Swipes

When a message has multiple versions:

1. Look for arrow buttons on the message
2. Click **left arrow** for previous swipe
3. Click **right arrow** for next swipe
4. Counter shows current position

**Tip:** All swipes are permanent — switching doesn't delete other versions.

### Edit Character Message

Modify what the character said:

1. Hover over the character's message
2. Click **Edit** (pencil icon)
3. Text becomes editable
4. Make changes
5. Click **Save** or **Cancel**

**What happens:**
- Message content is updated
- Original is not preserved (unlike swipes)
- Character "remembers" the edited version going forward

**Use cases:**
- Fix minor issues in an otherwise good response
- Adjust character voice or tone
- Remove unwanted content
- Add missing details

### Delete Character Message

Remove a character's message:

1. Hover over the message
2. Click **Delete** (trash icon)
3. Confirm deletion

**What happens:**
- Message permanently removed
- All swipes in the group are deleted
- Conversation continues from remaining messages

**Memory cascade:**
- May prompt about associated memories
- See [Memory Cascade](#memory-cascade-on-deletion) for details

### Reattribute Message (Multi-Character)

Change which character "said" a message:

1. Hover over the message
2. Click **Reattribute** or find in more options
3. Select a different character from the list
4. Confirm the change

**What happens:**
- Message now appears from the selected character
- Avatar and name update
- Context for future messages reflects the change

**Use cases:**
- AI responded as wrong character
- Response fits another character better
- Correcting turn order mistakes
- Reorganizing a scene

**Requirements:**
- Only available in multi-character chats
- Target character must be in the chat

## Swipe Groups

### What Are Swipe Groups?

A swipe group is a collection of alternative responses for the same prompt:

- **Original Response** — First generated response
- **Swipes** — Alternative versions created via regenerate
- **All Preserved** — Every version is kept

### Managing Swipes

**Adding swipes:**
- Click Regenerate to add another option
- No limit on number of swipes

**Viewing swipes:**
- Use arrows to navigate
- Position indicator shows current/total

**Deleting swipes:**
- Deleting the message deletes ALL swipes
- Cannot delete individual swipes from a group

### Swipe Best Practices

- **Generate multiple** — Compare options before continuing
- **Don't settle** — If none are right, edit or generate more
- **Use for variety** — See different character interpretations
- **Save good ones** — The current swipe is what's used for context

## Memory Cascade on Deletion

When deleting messages that have associated memories:

### What Triggers Memory Cascade

- Messages that were processed for memory extraction
- Important facts or information in the message
- Character knowledge derived from the message

### Options Presented

When deleting such messages, you may see:

1. **Delete memories too** — Remove the memories with the message
2. **Keep memories** — Preserve the memories even though message is gone
3. **Ask every time** — Get prompted for each deletion (default)

### Configuring Behavior

Set your default preference in Chat Settings:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Chat Settings**
2. Find **Memory Cascade** settings
3. Choose default behavior for deletions

## Bulk Actions

### Search and Replace

Find and replace text across all messages:

1. Open chat action menu (three dots in header)
2. Select **Search and Replace**
3. Enter text to find
4. Enter replacement text
5. Preview changes
6. Apply to selected or all messages

**Use cases:**
- Correct repeated spelling errors
- Update character names
- Fix terminology across conversation

### Bulk Character Replace

Reassign messages between characters:

1. Open chat action menu
2. Select **Bulk Character Replace** or similar
3. Choose source character
4. Choose destination character
5. Preview and confirm

**Use cases:**
- Swap which character said what
- Combine messages from removed character
- Correct systematic attribution errors

## Chat-Level Message Tools

These operate on the chat as a whole:

### Export Chat

Save the conversation:

1. Open chat action menu
2. Select **Export**
3. Choose format
4. File downloads

Includes all messages, swipes, and metadata.

### Clear Chat

Remove all messages (if available):

1. Open chat action menu
2. Select **Clear** or **Clear Messages**
3. Confirm action
4. All messages removed, chat remains

**Warning:** This is permanent and removes all content.

### Regenerate Last Response

Quick action to regenerate the most recent character message:

1. Look for regenerate button near input area
2. Or use keyboard shortcut if configured
3. Last character message regenerates

Faster than finding the message and clicking regenerate.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

Common message action shortcuts (may vary by configuration):

- **Ctrl/Cmd + E** — Edit selected message
- **Delete** — Delete selected message (with confirmation)
- **R** — Regenerate last response
- **Left/Right Arrows** — Navigate swipes (when focused on a swipe group)

Check Settings for your configured shortcuts.

## Message Action Tips

### For Roleplay Quality

- **Regenerate freely** — Don't settle for mediocre responses
- **Edit for polish** — Fine-tune good responses
- **Reattribute carefully** — Ensure character voices match
- **Delete sparingly** — Holes in context can confuse the AI

### For Conversation Flow

- **Use swipes** — Explore different directions
- **Edit over delete** — Preserve context when possible
- **Resend with tweaks** — Try different approaches to your message
- **Check swipe history** — Good alternatives might be in earlier swipes

### For Cost Management

- **Regenerate strategically** — Each swipe uses tokens
- **Edit instead of regenerate** — Minor fixes don't need new generation
- **Delete rather than regenerate repeatedly** — Start fresh if nothing works

### For Context Management

- **Edited messages become "truth"** — AI sees edited version
- **Deleted messages create gaps** — Subsequent messages may not make sense
- **Swipe selection matters** — Only current swipe is in context

## Troubleshooting

### Can't edit message

**Causes:**
- Message is currently generating
- Message is a system message
- UI issue

**Solutions:**
- Wait for generation to complete
- System messages can't be edited
- Refresh the page

### Regenerate produces same response

**Causes:**
- Temperature set too low
- Very specific prompt
- Limited valid responses

**Solutions:**
- Adjust temperature in connection profile
- Modify the prompt slightly
- Edit your preceding message to give more direction

### Swipe arrows not appearing

**Causes:**
- Only one version exists
- UI not updated
- Single-swipe message

**Solutions:**
- Generate a swipe first
- Refresh the page
- Check if message has alternatives

### Reattribute option missing

**Causes:**
- Single-character chat
- Only one character in chat
- Message type doesn't support reattribution

**Solutions:**
- Only works in multi-character chats
- Add another character to enable
- Check message is from a character (not system)

### Deleted message won't go away

**Causes:**
- Confirmation dialog waiting
- Network issue
- UI not refreshed

**Solutions:**
- Complete the confirmation
- Check network and try again
- Refresh the page

### Edit not saving

**Causes:**
- Network issue
- Validation error
- Concurrent edit

**Solutions:**
- Check network connection
- Try simpler edit
- Refresh and try again
