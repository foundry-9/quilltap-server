 *
 * One type and one resolver, so the tiers travel together. A call site that
 * threads only `projectMountPointIds` is the bug this module exists to prevent:
 * items moved into a group's `Wardrobe/` folder were invisible to every read
 * path, so nobody could wear the household livery hanging by the door.
 *
 * Precedence, mirroring `dedupeTierTriple` in `tiered-mount-pool.ts`:
 * **character > group > project > general**.
