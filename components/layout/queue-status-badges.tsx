/**
 * Queue Status Badges
 *
 * The compact chip group in the page toolbar — "Mem", "Emb", "Sum", "Dgr",
 * "Img" — reporting how much work of each kind is in flight right now.
 *
 * What a chip counts is defined once, server-side and client-side alike, in
 * `lib/background-jobs/activity-kinds`: active `background_jobs` rows mapped to
 * their kind, plus non-job work registered with the activity registry (the
 * inline image tool, the Concierge classifier, live embedding calls). A chip is
 * lit for the entire span of the work it names, from the first token of prompt
 * crafting through to the result landing.
 *
 * How the counts arrive:
 * - **Push, normally.** The server publishes a `jobs` hint from every queue
 *   chokepoint — enqueue, claim, complete, fail, cancel, and both edges of an
 *   activity span — and the realtime provider invalidates this query. The bus
 *   coalesces, so a thousand-job reindex is a stream of hints the chips can
 *   actually keep up with.
 * - **Polling, as the fallback.** While the socket is down the original
 *   adaptive heartbeat comes back: a fast tick while something is in flight, a
 *   slow one while everything is idle. A dropped connection costs latency, not
 *   correctness.
 * - `notifyQueueChange()` remains as an instant same-tab kick after a
 *   known-enqueuing action, but nothing depends on it any more.
 *
 * Work that starts and finishes between two reads would otherwise be invisible,
 * so the API also returns a monotonic `startedByKind` counter; a chip that has
 * advanced since the previous read pulses even if its live count is back to
 * zero. That stays exactly as it was — it is the missed-event insurance this
 * design wants, push or no push.
