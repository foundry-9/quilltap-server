/**
 * Composed outfits — the pool split the composer UI runs on.
 *
 * A wardrobe item is either a **garment** (a leaf: a shirt, a pair of boots,
 * or a dress covering `["top","bottom"]` — multi-slot, but still one thing you
 * put on) or a **composed outfit** (a composite: an item assembled out of
 * other items via `componentItemIds`). The distinction is `isBundle`, and this
 * module is only the sorted selection built on top of it.
 *
 * The composer surfaces the two differently: outfits hang off the single
 * "Wear an outfit" pull-down at the top, garments fill the per-slot pickers.
 * Without that split every bundle appeared once per slot it covered, three
 * rows deep, crowding out the garments actually meant for the slot.
 *
