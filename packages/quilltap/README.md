# Quilltap

**Self-hosted AI workspace for writers, worldbuilders, roleplayers, and anyone who wants an AI assistant that actually knows what they're working on.**

Run Quilltap as a local Node.js server with zero configuration.

## Quick Start

```bash
npm install -g quilltap
quilltap
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

On first run, the CLI downloads the application files (~150-250 MB compressed) and caches them locally. Subsequent launches start instantly.

## Installation

### Install globally (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g quilltap
quilltap
```

### Run directly (no install)

```bash
npx quilltap
```

## Usage

```
quilltap [options]

Options:
  -p, --port <number>     Port to listen on (default: 3000)
  -d, --data-dir <path>   Data directory (default: platform-specific)
  -o, --open              Open browser after server starts
  -v, --version           Show version number
  --update                Force re-download of application files
  -h, --help              Show this help message
```

### Examples

```bash
# Start on default port 3000
quilltap

# Start on a custom port
quilltap --port 8080

# Use a custom data directory
quilltap --data-dir /mnt/data/quilltap

# Start and open browser automatically
quilltap --open

# Force re-download after a manual update
quilltap --update
```

## How It Works

The `quilltap` npm package is a lightweight CLI launcher (~10 KB). On first run, it downloads the pre-built application from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/foundry-9/quilltap-server/releases) and caches it in a platform-specific directory. Native modules (`better-sqlite3`, `sharp`) are compiled for your platform when you install the npm package.

### Cache Locations

| Platform | Cache Directory |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Caches/Quilltap/standalone/` |
| Linux | `~/.cache/quilltap/standalone/` |
| Windows | `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Quilltap\standalone\` |

When you upgrade to a new version (`npm update -g quilltap`), the next run detects the version mismatch and downloads the matching application files automatically.

## Data Directory

Quilltap stores its database, files, and logs in a platform-specific directory:

| Platform | Default Location |
| --- | --- |
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/Quilltap` |
| Linux | `~/.quilltap` |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\Quilltap` |

Override with `--data-dir` or the `QUILLTAP_DATA_DIR` environment variable.

## Named Instances

Register a data directory once and point the CLI at it by name, instead of repeating `--data-dir`:

```bash
quilltap instances add Friday ~/iCloud/Quilltap/Friday   # Register (prompts for the passphrase if encrypted)
quilltap instances list                                  # Registered instances (* marks the default)
quilltap instances default Friday                        # Make it the fall-through for flag-free runs
quilltap instances rename Friday Weekday                 # Rename, preserving the stored passphrase
quilltap instances remove Friday                         # Unregister
```

Every subcommand then accepts `--instance <name>` in place of `--data-dir`. The registry lives at `<app-support>/Quilltap/instances.json` (mode 0600; e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/Quilltap/instances.json` on macOS). **Resolution precedence:** `--data-dir` > `--instance` > registered default > `QUILLTAP_DATA_DIR` > the OS platform default. Pass the **instance root** (e.g. `~/iCloud/Quilltap/Friday`), not its `data/` subdirectory.

## Database Tool

The encrypted SQLite databases (main, LLM logs, mount index) can be queried directly via `quilltap db`. There are two modes: high-level subcommands that auto-pick the right database and resolve characters/chats/projects by name, and a low-level path for arbitrary SQL.

### Subcommands

```bash
quilltap db schema                          # Tables grouped by domain
quilltap db schema chat_messages            # Columns, indexes, DDL.md link
quilltap db schema --grep memory            # Find tables/columns by substring

quilltap db find character Friday           # Resolve a name to a UUID (fuzzy)
quilltap db find chat "physical prompts"
quilltap db find project "Quilltap"

quilltap db chats --character Friday        # All chats containing a character
quilltap db chats --project "Quilltap"      # All chats in a project
quilltap db messages --chat <id|title> --last 50 --full
quilltap db logs --chat <id|title>          # LLM logs for a chat
quilltap db logs --message <id>             # LLM logs for a single message
quilltap db logs --character Friday         # LLM logs by character
quilltap db logs --tail 20                  # Recent LLM logs

quilltap db message <id>                    # Full content of one message
quilltap db log <id> [--field request|response|both]
quilltap db memories --character Friday [--about Amy] [--source AUTO]
quilltap db characters status               # Per-character vault readiness (--id, --diverged, --blocked)
```

### Maintenance and Snapshots

```bash
quilltap db optimize                        # VACUUM + ANALYZE + PRAGMA optimize (all DBs)
quilltap db optimize main                   # one DB; refuses while server is running

quilltap db backup                          # online snapshot of all three DBs
quilltap db backup main --out /tmp/snap     # one DB to a chosen directory
quilltap db backup --json                   # parseable per-target sizes + durations

quilltap db integrity                       # cipher_integrity_check + integrity_check
quilltap db integrity llm-logs              # one DB; exit 0 ok, 1 issues, 2 open failure
```

`backup` and `integrity` are safe to run while the server is up; `optimize` refuses while a live lock is held. Backups default to `<dataDir>/backups/<timestamp>/` and inherit the source's encryption key transparently.

Most subcommands accept `--json` (for piping) and `--limit N`. Names are case-insensitive; aliases are searched alongside character names. Ambiguous matches print all candidates and exit non-zero.

### Low-level options

```bash
quilltap db --tables                                # List tables in active DB
quilltap db --count chat_messages                   # Row count
quilltap db "SELECT id FROM characters LIMIT 5"     # Raw SQL (read-only)
quilltap db --repl                                  # Interactive prompt (read-only)
quilltap db --write "UPDATE characters SET title = 'rival' WHERE id = '...'"
quilltap db --repl --write                          # Interactive, read-write
quilltap db --llm-logs --tables                     # Target the LLM logs DB
quilltap db --mount-points --tables                 # Target the mount index DB
```

The database is opened **read-only by default**. Add `--write` to make changes: it opens the database read-write, **claims the instance lock** (`<dataDir>/quilltap.lock`) for the duration, and releases it on exit. It **refuses — with no override — if a running server or another instance holds the lock**, so stop the server first. `--repl` is read-only unless combined with `--write`. Attempting a write without `--write` fails with a hint to re-run with the flag.

In the REPL, `.cols <table>` and `.find <text>` mirror the subcommand helpers.

## Document Stores (Scriptorium)

`quilltap docs` exposes the document-store machinery from the command line. Read-only verbs open the mount-index DB directly and work without the server; write and pipeline verbs talk to the running server via `/api/v1/mount-points/[id]`.

```bash
# Read
quilltap docs list                              # All mounts
quilltap docs show <mount>                      # One mount, with counts
quilltap docs ls <mount> [path] [--links]       # POSIX-flavoured listing (alias: dir)
quilltap docs tree <mount> [path]               # ASCII tree of a folder hierarchy (--depth, --max-nodes)
quilltap docs read [--rendered] <mount> <path>  # File contents → stdout
quilltap docs export <mount> <outputDir>        # Mount → directory
quilltap docs find <pattern>                    # Substring match on file names (--mount, --ext, --type, --limit)
quilltap docs grep <pattern>                    # Substring match on extracted text (--mount, --ignore-case, -l, --max, --context)
quilltap docs status                            # Per-mount extraction + embedding rollup (--mount, --top)

# Server-required
quilltap docs scan <mount>                                    # Trigger a rescan
quilltap docs reindex <mount> [path] [--force]                # Re-extract + re-chunk
quilltap docs embed <mount> [path] [--force] [--wait]         # Enqueue embedding jobs
quilltap docs write [--force] [--base64] <mount> <path> [file]  # Stdin or file → mount
quilltap docs read [--rendered] [--base64] <mount> <path>       # File contents → stdout
quilltap docs delete <mount> <path>                           # Idempotent delete
quilltap docs mkdir <mount> <path>                            # Idempotent folder create
quilltap docs move <srcMount> <srcPath> <dstMount> <dstPath>  # Move (hard-link when possible)
quilltap docs copy [--force] <srcMount> <srcPath> <dstMount> <dstPath>
quilltap docs link <srcMount> <srcPath> <dstMount> <dstPath>  # Hard-link (server-required; no byte copy)
quilltap docs rmdir <mount> <path>                            # Delete an empty folder (server-required)
quilltap docs mvdir <mount> <fromPath> <toPath>               # Rename/move a folder (server-required)
```

Mount arguments accept the mount name (case-insensitive) or a UUID; ambiguous names print candidates and exit non-zero. `--json` is supported by every verb; `reindex`, `embed`, `link`, `rmdir`, and `mvdir` refuse to run without a reachable server.

### `--base64` flag

`write --base64`: reads the source bytes and sends them to the server via `PUT /api/v1/mount-points/{mountId}/files/{path}` with `{content: <base64>, encoding: "base64"}`. This is the portable path the file browser uses and handles arbitrary binary files cleanly. Server-required; the direct filesystem fallback is not available with this flag.

`read --base64`: fetches raw bytes via `GET /api/v1/mount-points/{mountId}/files/{path}?encoding=base64` and emits the decoded bytes to stdout, suitable for binary round-trips. Server-required.

### `link`, `rmdir`, `mvdir`

`link` calls `POST /api/v1/mount-points/{srcMountId}?action=link-file` with `{sourcePath, destMountPointId, destPath}`. Creates a true hard link with no byte copy; the server reports back a `strategy` field. Errors: `DEST_EXISTS` (exit 2), `UNSUPPORTED` (cross-storage or cross-device), `SOURCE_NOT_FOUND`.

`rmdir` calls `POST /api/v1/mount-points/{mountId}?action=delete-folder` with `{path}`. Fails with a clear message if the folder is not empty (`NOT_EMPTY` / `CONFLICT`).

`mvdir` calls `POST /api/v1/mount-points/{mountId}?action=move-folder` with `{fromPath, toPath}`. Fails with exit 2 if the destination already exists (`DEST_EXISTS`).

## Memories

`quilltap memories` exposes the same Commonplace Book that each character carries — searchable, sortable, graphable, but never writable. All verbs open the main encrypted DB read-only.

```bash
quilltap memories ls                                                   # All holders, default sort: reinforcedImportance DESC
quilltap memories ls --character Ariadne --sort created --limit 10     # One holder, newest first
quilltap memories find "concrete examples"                             # Substring match on summary (--in content|both)
quilltap memories grep -i --max 3 --context 1 "concrete examples"      # Pattern search inside content, with snippets
quilltap memories show <id|prefix> [--depth N] [--no-related]          # Full record + related-memory neighbourhood
quilltap memories tree <id|prefix> [--depth N] [--max-nodes N]         # ASCII walk of the bidirectional related-memory graph
quilltap memories status [--character <name|id>]                       # Per-holder rollup + dangling-edge check
```

Shared filter flags apply to `ls`, `find`, `grep`, and `status` where they make sense: `--character`, `--about` (with `self` / `none` shortcuts), `--source`, `--chat` (with `none` for manual entries), `--project`, `--since`, `--until`, `--min-importance`, `--min-reinforced`, `--has-embedding` / `--no-embedding`. Sort flags (`--sort reinforced|importance|created|accessed|reinforcement-count|links`, plus `-r` to reverse) apply to `ls`, `find`, and `grep`. Names accept fuzzy substrings; ambiguous names print candidates and exit 2. `--json` is supported by every verb. The legacy `quilltap db memories --character <name>` verb remains undisturbed.

## Memory Extraction Dry-Run

`quilltap memory-diff <chatId>` is a diagnostic that dumps a chat's existing memories and dry-runs re-extraction against it **without writing anything** — useful for seeing how an extractor change would land on a real conversation.

```bash
quilltap memory-diff <chatId> --instance Friday          # Report to the current directory
quilltap memory-diff <chatId> --out /tmp/diff --concurrency 8
```

Needs a running server (`--port`, default 3000) to reach the extraction pipeline. `--out <dir>` sets the report destination (default: cwd); `--concurrency N` bounds parallel turns (default 4, max 32).

## Recall Replay

`quilltap recall-replay <chatId>` replays a turn's memory recall against the running server and prints the candidate table twice — the pre-overhaul ranking vs. the episodic (retrospective / time-window / entity-anchored) ranking — with cosine, blend, every multiplier fired, and head selection per row. Read-only; used to tune the recall constants against real "the character forgot" turns.

```bash
quilltap recall-replay <chatId>                 # Replay the last turn
quilltap recall-replay <chatId> --turn 42       # Replay at interchange 42 (its own clock)
quilltap recall-replay <chatId> --json          # Raw JSON for scripting
```

Flags: `--turn <n>` (default: last), `--char <characterId>` (default: first LLM-controlled participant), `--limit <n>` (default 25), `--port <n>` (default 3000), `--json`.

## Maintenance & Cleanup

`quilltap maintenance` is the manual trigger for the retention sweeps that otherwise run on the server's daily maintenance tick. It reaps data with no bearing on characters, stories, or memories.

```bash
quilltap maintenance status                  # Read-only: last sweep time + dry-run counts of what would be reaped
quilltap maintenance status --instance Friday --json
quilltap maintenance run --instance Friday    # Run the sweeps once (lock-gated; refuses while the server is up)
```

`maintenance run` is a DB writer: it claims `<dataDir>/quilltap.lock` and **refuses while a running Quilltap server holds it** — stop the server first. Because it can only run with the server down, it performs the sweeps expressible as direct SQL/filesystem work: reaping finished background jobs (COMPLETED after 7 days, DEAD after 30, keyed off `completedAt`), closed terminal sessions older than 30 days plus their transcript files, and orphaned mount-index files. The **stale-chat asset collapse** (superseded story-backgrounds and wardrobe avatars) needs the server's file-storage machinery and runs only on the server's daily tick — `status` reports a stale-chat count so you can see the backlog. Retention windows mirror `lib/background-jobs/maintenance/retention-constants.ts`.

## Logs

`quilltap logs` tails or prints an instance's log files without hunting down the logs directory. Prefer it over `tail -f` — it follows across log rotation and can merge streams.

```bash
quilltap logs                                 # Last 100 lines of combined.log
quilltap logs --tail 0 --stream error         # Whole error log
quilltap logs -f --grep "MEMORY_EXTRACTION"   # Follow, filtered by regex
quilltap logs --stream combined,error         # Merge streams with [stream] prefixes
```

Flags: `--stream combined|error|stdout|stderr|startup` (comma-separated for multiple), `--tail N` (default 100; `0` = full file), `--follow` / `-f`, `--grep <pattern>` (JS regex). Resolves the logs directory via the same `--instance` / `--data-dir` plumbing as the rest of the CLI.

## Migrations

`quilltap migrations` inspects migration state read-only. The actual runner stays at server startup (where the loading screen reports progress), so the CLI deliberately won't apply anything.

```bash
quilltap migrations status        # Counts: in-source vs recorded-applied vs not-yet-recorded
quilltap migrations pending       # Just the not-yet-recorded list
quilltap migrations run --dry-run # List what would run (refuses without --dry-run)
```

`--json` works on all three. "Not yet recorded" includes migrations whose `shouldRun()` is `false` on this instance — the CLI doesn't evaluate the predicate, so it can't distinguish "would skip" from "would run."

## File Verification

`quilltap file-verify` force-downloads an instance's cloud-evicted (dataless) top-level data files so the databases are fully local before anything opens them. It reads each placeholder, which faults it in through the cloud provider (iCloud Drive, etc.). Safe to run repeatedly — a no-op when nothing is evicted. macOS only for now.

```bash
quilltap file-verify --instance Ignite        # Fault in only the dataless top-level files
quilltap file-verify --instance Friday --all  # Read every top-level file, not just dataless ones
quilltap file-verify --instance Friday --json # Machine-readable report
```

Only the **top-level** files of the data directory are considered; the `backups/` subdirectory is left alone. Flags: `--all` (read every top-level file, not just dataless ones), `--stall-ms <ms>` (treat a download as stalled after this many ms with no bytes per chunk; default 30000), `--json`. Resolves the instance via the usual `--instance` / `--data-dir` plumbing.

## Theme Management

The CLI includes theme management commands:

```bash
quilltap themes list                    # List all installed themes
quilltap themes install my.qtap-theme   # Install a .qtap-theme bundle
quilltap themes validate my.qtap-theme  # Validate a bundle
quilltap themes uninstall my-theme      # Uninstall a bundle theme
quilltap themes export earl-grey        # Export any theme as a bundle
quilltap themes create sunset           # Scaffold a new theme
quilltap themes search "dark"           # Search registries
quilltap themes update                  # Check for theme updates
quilltap themes registry list           # List configured registries
quilltap themes registry add <url>      # Add a registry source
```

## Shell Completion

Tab-completion for bash, zsh, and fish. Pick the block that matches your shell.

### Bash

Append the generated script to `~/.bashrc`:

```bash
quilltap completion bash >> ~/.bashrc
```

Or drop it into a system completion directory:

```bash
quilltap completion bash > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d/quilltap
# Linux with admin rights: /etc/bash_completion.d/quilltap
```

Restart the shell, or `source ~/.bashrc`.

### Zsh

Two reasonable ways to wire this up; pick one.

**Option A — one line in `.zshrc`** (simpler; adds noticeable shell-startup latency because `quilltap` runs every time you open a new shell):

```zsh
# In ~/.zshrc:
source <(quilltap completion zsh)
```

**Option B — canonical `fpath` setup** (faster; what zsh expects):

```zsh
# In ~/.zshrc, before compinit runs:
fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)
autoload -Uz compinit
compinit
```

Then once, from any shell:

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions
quilltap completion zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_quilltap
```

The leading underscore on `_quilltap` is the zsh convention — it tells `compinit` this is a completion definition file rather than a regular autoloaded function.

**oh-my-zsh users:** the framework runs `compinit` for you, so either set the `fpath` line *before* the framework loads, or delete the cache (`rm -f ~/.zcompdump*`) after dropping the file in and start a new shell. The more idiomatic location under oh-my-zsh is:

```zsh
mkdir -p ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/quilltap
quilltap completion zsh > ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/quilltap/_quilltap
# then add `quilltap` to the plugins=(...) line in ~/.zshrc
```

### Fish

```fish
quilltap completion fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/quilltap.fish
```

Fish picks new completion files up automatically — no shell restart needed.

### What gets completed

- **Subcommands**: `quilltap d<TAB>` → `db docs`
- **Sub-verbs per namespace**: `quilltap db s<TAB>` → `schema show`
- **Instance names**: `quilltap --instance Fr<TAB>` → registered instances
- **Mount names**: `quilltap docs ls --mount Qu<TAB>` → mount points in the active instance

Dynamic completions shell out to `quilltap`'s own subcommands. If the active instance is encrypted and no passphrase is reachable, the completion silently returns nothing rather than prompting in the middle of a tab.
