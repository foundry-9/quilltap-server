/**
 * General Wardrobe — read helpers for the instance-wide `Wardrobe/` folder
 * inside the singleton "Quilltap General" mount point.
 *
 * Post-cutover, shared wardrobe archetypes (the old `characterId = null` rows)
 * live here as `Wardrobe/*.md` files rather than in the `wardrobe_items` DB
 * table. They are offered to every character as fallback components and as
 * shared items in the wardrobe UI. The mount itself is provisioned by
 * `migrations/scripts/provision-general-mount.ts`; its id is persisted in
 * `instance_settings.generalMountPointId` and read via `getGeneralMountPointId()`.
 *
 * All helpers degrade gracefully when the mount has not yet been provisioned
 * (returning empty results / null) so a freshly-cloned database doesn't 500
 * the API during the race window before startup finishes migrations.
 *
