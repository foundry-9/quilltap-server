/**
 * Group Store Backfill
 *
 * On server startup, ensures every Group has a populated official document
 * store — the store the group-store overlay reads from. Mirrors
 * `backfillProjectStores()`.
 *
 * For each group:
 *   1. Ensure `officialMountPointId` points at a real store (`ensureOwnerOfficialStore`).
 *   2. If the store has no `properties.json`, populate all four overlay files
 *      (`description.md` / `instructions.md` / `state.json` / `properties.json`)
 *      from the raw row via `writeGroupStoreManagedFields`.
 *
 * This is the self-heal for imports and any group that slipped through the
 * cutover migration (e.g. a blocked migration that left some groups without
 * files while the columns still exist). It is the safety net behind the
 * "no column-aware fallback" read overlay: the cutover migration populates
 * files authoritatively before serving; this catches the stragglers.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: reads via `findAllRaw()` — the overlay would throw/drop the very
 * storeless groups we're here to heal. The raw row carries the legacy column
 * values pre-cutover, so the populator writes real data; post-cutover the
 * columns are gone and only defaults remain (restore from backup for lost data).
 *
 * Because that populate step is destructive post-cutover, step 2 fires only on
 * a genuinely absent `properties.json`. `readGroupStoreProperties` throws for a
 * store that exists but is unreadable, which routes to the per-group catch and
 * leaves the files alone — healing a group we merely failed to read would
 * flatten its settings, description, instructions, and state to defaults.
 *
 * Idempotent: groups whose store already has `properties.json` are skipped.
 * Per-group failures are logged and do not stop the remainder of the run.
