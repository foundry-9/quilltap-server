# The Instance Registry

Each Quilltap installation — each self-contained workspace with its own database, files, and settings — occupies a separate directory on your machine, called an *instance*. The default location depends on your operating system: `~/Library/Application Support/Quilltap/` on macOS, `~/.quilltap/` on Linux, and `%APPDATA%\Quilltap\` on Windows. But Quilltap invites you to maintain several instances in parallel. You might keep a Friday instance for personal projects, an Ignite instance for collaborative work, and perhaps a Staging instance for testing imported data. The `quilltap instances` command is the registry that keeps track of them.

## The Instance Registry

Each registered instance has a friendly name, a filesystem path to its root directory, and an optional database passphrase. When you register an instance, you can thereafter invoke `quilltap --instance Friday` instead of spelling out the full path and passphrase on the command line. The registry lives in a single `instances.json` file in your user configuration directory (the same parent directory that would hold the default instance, had you never registered one).

## Basic Operations

### Listing Your Instances

```text
quilltap instances list
```

Shows all registered instances, one per row, with their paths and passphrase status. If you have set a default instance, it is marked with an asterisk (`*`).

### Adding an Instance

```text
quilltap instances add <name> [<path>]
```

Registers a new instance. Prompts for the path if not supplied on the command line. If the instance directory has an encrypted database, prompts for the passphrase and verifies it against the `.dbkey` file before saving.

### Viewing One Instance

```text
quilltap instances show <name>
```

Prints the name, path, passphrase status, and presence of data files (`.dbkey`, `quilltap.db`) for one instance.

### Removing an Instance

```text
quilltap instances remove <name>
quilltap instances rm <name>
quilltap instances delete <name>
```

Forgets an instance from the registry. Does not touch the instance's files on disk. If the removed instance was set as the default, the default is cleared.

## Managing Passphrases

### Setting or Changing a Passphrase

```text
quilltap instances set-passphrase <name>
```

Prompts for a new database passphrase, verifies it against the `.dbkey` file (if present), and saves it to the registry. You can also clear an existing passphrase with the same command.

## Default Instance

When you invoke `quilltap` (the server, or most CLI subcommands) without the `--instance` or `--data-dir` flag, the CLI resolves your target instance in this order:

1. **Registered default** (if one is set) — see below
2. **`QUILLTAP_DATA_DIR` environment variable** (if set)
3. **OS platform default** (the system-standard location for your OS)

If you frequently work in the same instance, you can mark it as the default and thereafter omit the flag entirely.

### Setting a Default Instance

```text
quilltap instances default <name>
```

Marks `<name>` as the default. Subsequent `quilltap` invocations will use that instance's path unless overridden with `--instance` or `--data-dir`.

### Viewing the Current Default

```text
quilltap instances default
```

Prints the name of the default instance (or `(none)` if no default is set).

### Clearing the Default

```text
quilltap instances default --clear
```

Unsets the default instance. Thereafter, `quilltap` will fall back to the environment variable (if set) or the OS platform default.

## Renaming an Instance

```text
quilltap instances rename <old> <new>
```

Renames an instance in the registry. The stored path and passphrase are preserved; only the friendly name changes. If the renamed instance was set as the default, the default is updated to the new name.

## Rebuilding a Lost Key

```text
quilltap instances restore-key <name>
quilltap instances restore-key <name> --no-passphrase --yes
```

A calamity, but not a catastrophe. Should an instance's `quilltap.dbkey` go missing — deleted in a
fit of tidying, lost with a failed sync, or simply locked behind a passphrase that has slipped the
mind entirely — this command builds a new one. The key file, you see, does not *contain* the secret
so much as wrap it up in brown paper: the pepper printed for you at first-run setup is the actual
key to the database. An operator who kept that slip of paper is never truly locked out, and this is
the only way back in from outside the application, a forgotten passphrase being quite immune to the
usual remedies.

The pepper is read from the `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_PEPPER` environment variable, or else asked for at a
hidden prompt. It is never accepted as a flag — a command line has an indiscreet habit of lingering
in shell history and parading itself through `ps` — and it is proved against the encrypted databases
actually on disk before a single byte is written. A key file wrapping the *wrong* pepper is worse
than no key file at all: the application would unwrap it quite cheerfully, hand the database a key
that opens nothing, and pronounce a perfectly healthy instance corrupt.

Run it with the server stopped. The command declines while the instance lock is held, the running
process having already committed both the pepper and the passphrase to memory, where it would go on
consulting them in blithe ignorance of your new file. Any existing key is copied aside to
`quilltap.dbkey.bak-<timestamp>` first.

Accepts `--passphrase <pass>` or `--no-passphrase` (the wrapping for the new file), `-d,
--data-dir <path>` for an instance that was never registered, `--force` (proceed where there is no
encrypted database to prove the pepper against), and `-y, --yes` to skip the confirmations. A
registered instance's stored passphrase is brought into line with whatever you choose. `rebuild-key`
is accepted as an alias.

One thing it does not do: character **archive** bundles are keyed on the passphrase rather than the
pepper, and only the application's own Change Passphrase card rewrites them. Bundles made under a
passphrase you have just replaced will still want the old one.

## Hidden Flags

`--json` on `list` or `default` emits JSON output instead of a human-readable table. Used by shell completion and automation.

`--names-only` on `list` prints one instance name per line, useful for programmatic queries.

## In-Chat Navigation

The Instance Registry is part of the Quilltap CLI and lives outside the chat interface. If you need to manage instances, open a terminal and run `quilltap instances --help` for a quick reference, or run any command without `--help` to see it interactively.
