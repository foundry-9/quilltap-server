# Data Retention — The Nightly Tidying of Quiet Rooms

> **[Open this setting in Quilltap](/settings?tab=chat&section=data-retention)**

Every conversation you keep, Quilltap keeps in full — every word, forever, or until you say otherwise. But a conversation also gathers a certain amount of behind-the-scenes paraphernalia as it goes: compression caches, pre-rendered pages, the models' own scratch-work and thinking traces, and the mathematical fingerprints (embeddings) that let semantic search find things by meaning rather than by exact words. In a busy establishment, the quiet rooms end up storing rather a lot of this — none of it part of the story, all of it faithfully rebuilt on demand.

The **Data Retention** setting tells the nightly housekeeping how long a chat must sit idle before its working data is tidied away.

## What "idle" means

A chat is considered idle when nobody has *actually spoken* in it for the configured number of days — you, or one of your characters. Announcements from the Staff (the Lantern's image notes, the Host's room business, Prospero's tool reports, and their colleagues) do not count as activity; a room isn't "in use" merely because the servants have been dusting it.

## What gets tidied — and what never is

Once a chat crosses the threshold, the nightly sweep clears:

- **Regenerable caches** — compression caches and pre-rendered text, rebuilt automatically the next time they're wanted.
- **Model scratch-work** — raw provider payloads, thinking/reasoning traces, and memory-extraction debug logs from old messages. These are diagnostic ephemera; the messages themselves are untouched.
- **Superseded generated images** — old story backgrounds and outfit avatars the chat no longer references (the current ones always stay; so does anything you saved to a gallery or promoted to a character).
- **Conversation embeddings** — the semantic-search fingerprints of the chat's interchanges. The rendered text of each interchange is kept, so keyword search still works.

Never touched, at any age: the messages themselves, attachments, memories, conversation summaries, and anything you deliberately saved.

## Search while a chat is cold

A tidied ("cold") chat remains fully readable, and **keyword search** over it works exactly as before. **Semantic search** — the kind that finds a conversation by meaning, through the Scriptorium or conversation-summary retrieval — will not surface a cold chat until it has been re-indexed. That happens automatically the moment you reopen the chat (Quilltap quietly queues the re-embedding in the background), or you can force the matter for any conversation by clicking its **Scriptorium status badge** on the chat's card in the Salon list, which re-renders and re-embeds the whole affair.

## Configuring the window

1. Open **Settings → Chat Settings → Data Retention**
2. Set **"Keep inactive chats' working data for N days"** (1–3650; the default is 30)
3. The setting applies to the entire establishment — there is deliberately no per-chat dial

A longer window means less tidying and a larger database; a shorter one keeps the cellars lean at the cost of the occasional background re-index when you revisit an old haunt.

## Reclaiming the space

The sweep frees space *inside* the database file; the file itself shrinks only when compacted. When you'd like the bytes back on disk, stop the server and run:

```
npx quilltap db optimize
```

which performs a VACUUM and re-tunes the query planner while it's at it.
