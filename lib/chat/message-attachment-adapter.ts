/**
 * Re-deciding the attachment question after the model changes underneath a
 * message array.
 *
 * A formatted message array is built once, against one connection profile.
 * `processFileAttachmentFallback` runs at that moment and answers, for that
 * profile: send the raw bytes, or replace them with a description? Whichever
 * it answers is baked into the array — raw `attachments` on the anchor
 * message, or description text prepended to its content.
 *
 * Every mid-turn model swap inherits that array. The uncensored reroute is the
 * one that bit us: a vision profile's array, bytes and all, handed to a
 * text-only substitute, which the gateway refuses with a 400 before the
 * remedy has a chance to run (bug 106). The failure is structural rather than
 * unlucky — the answer in the array was computed for a model that is no longer
 * the one being called.
 *
 * `adaptMessagesForProfile` asks the question again, for the profile actually
 * about to be called. An image a text-only stand-in cannot read becomes its
 * description, exactly as it would have if that profile had been the primary,
 * and the retry proceeds instead of dying at the gateway. A profile that *can*
 * take the bytes gets the array back untouched — same reference, no copy, no
 * describer spent.
