# The Scriptorium

Consider, if you will, the predicament of the well-read conversationalist who possesses an impressive private library but cannot consult it during discussion. The document mount point system corrects this unfortunate oversight by allowing you to point Quilltap at directories full of documents — your notes, your research, your accumulated wisdom filed away in Markdown, PDF, Word, or plain text — and have their contents indexed, chunked, embedded, and made searchable alongside your memories and conversation history.

## How It Works

A mount point is simply a filesystem path — a directory on your machine (or perhaps an Obsidian vault, if you are the sort of person who maintains such things) that contains documents you wish your AI collaborators to be able to reference. When you create a mount point, Quilltap scans the directory, converts each supported document to plain text, divides that text into semantically coherent chunks, and generates embeddings for each chunk using your configured embedding profile.

### Store Backends

- **Filesystem** — A directory on your own drive, scanned and watched in the traditional manner
- **Obsidian Vault** — A filesystem store with sensible defaults for the Obsidian sort of person (hidden `.obsidian` folders are politely ignored)
- **Database-backed** — An entirely self-contained store that lives inside Quilltap's own encrypted `quilltap-mount-index.db` rather than on disk. Choose this when you want a portable, tamper-resistant reference shelf that travels with your data directory and needs no filesystem path at all. The usual SQLCipher encryption and the 24-hour physical backup sweep apply automatically. Folders are tracked as first-class entities within the store, enabling reliable path resolution and hierarchy management.

### Supported Formats

For filesystem and Obsidian stores:

- **Markdown** (`.md`) — Syntax is stripped; the text beneath remains
- **Plain text** (`.txt`) — Used as-is, because sometimes simplicity is its own reward
- **PDF** (`.pdf`) — Text is extracted; images and formatting are, regrettably, left behind
- **Word documents** (`.docx`) — The raw text is pulled from the elaborate XML machinery within

Database-backed stores accept a wider palette than their filesystem cousins. Markdown, plain text, JSON, and JSONL live as native text in `doc_mount_documents`. PDFs and Word documents are stored in their original binary glory alongside a plain-text extraction used for embedding and searching. Bitmap images (PNG, JPEG, GIF, TIFF, HEIC, HEIF, AVIF) are transcoded to WebP on upload; already-WebP uploads are stored as-is. Any *other* file type — zip archives, audio, video, obscure proprietary formats, the sort of binaries one keeps "just in case" — can be uploaded too. They arrive in the store as blobs with no text representation, ready for a future converter to derive text from them; they will not appear in embedding searches until such a converter exists, but they travel with the store, survive backups, and can be referenced or downloaded at will.

### Unified Uploads and the Blob Layer

Every document store — regardless of backend — may hold binary assets. On database-backed stores, the **Upload** button at the top of the file list is the one-stop entrance for *anything*: Markdown, images, PDFs, Word documents, or arbitrary binaries. Uploaded files slide into the same table as scanned files, with a badge indicating their type and a row you can expand for further details: thumbnail (for images), MIME type, original filename, extraction status, and a description field that feeds the semantic search pipeline.

For PDF and DOCX uploads, Quilltap extracts the plain text at the moment of ingestion, files it alongside the original bytes, chunks it, and enqueues embedding jobs — which means your AI collaborators can search the *contents* of PDFs in the same breath as your Markdown notes, without you having to pre-convert anything. When a character calls `doc_read_file` on a PDF or DOCX in a database-backed store, they receive the extracted text with a small note indicating the content was derived from the binary (the original bytes remain available separately through the blob endpoint).

Reference a blob from any Markdown document in the same store with a relative path:

```markdown
![A portrait of the distinguished Dr Aubergine](images/aubergine.webp)
```

When the document is rendered in a chat with Document Mode open, the image loads from the mount point's blob API endpoint — no public URLs, no off-machine hosting.

### Change Detection

Quilltap keeps your document stores current through two complementary mechanisms. On each startup, a full sweep reconciles every file against its SHA-256 checksum — new files are ingested, modified files are re-chunked, and files that have vanished from the directory have their records quietly removed. While the server is running, a filesystem watcher stands quietly at attention behind each enabled filesystem store: the moment a file is saved, moved, or deleted by any program on your machine, the watcher notices, updates the index, and enqueues a fresh embedding job — generally within a second or two of the change. You need not lift a finger, and you need not restart the server.

Should you prefer to disable the live watcher — or should you find yourself storing documents on a network share where the usual filesystem events are unreliable — set the environment variable `QUILLTAP_WATCHER_POLLING=1` to switch the watcher into a polite polling mode that works universally at the cost of a little extra CPU.

Database-backed stores, having no filesystem to watch, rely instead on an in-process event bridge: every write performed through the `doc_*` tools or the mount-point API is captured at the moment of its arrival and the embedding scheduler is nudged accordingly. The "Scan Now" button on a database-backed store re-emits a write event for each document, which has the practical effect of re-chunking and re-embedding the entire store — useful when you have changed your embedding profile and wish to rebuild the index.

### Chunking

Documents are divided into chunks of approximately 800 to 1,200 tokens each, with a 200-token overlap between consecutive chunks to prevent important context from falling into the cracks between segments. The chunking algorithm respects paragraph boundaries where possible and tracks heading context, so each chunk knows what section of the document it belongs to.

## Managing Document Stores

Document stores are managed from the **Scriptorium** page, accessible via the database icon in the left sidebar. From there you can:

- **Add** a document store by providing a name and filesystem path
- **Classify** each store with a *Contents* label — **Documents** (the default; notes, references, research) or **Character** (character sheets and allied Aurora material). This classification sits alongside the mount type and can be changed at any time from the edit dialog. When a *database-backed* store is created — or flipped — with the **Character** classification, Quilltap lays in a preset scaffold to save you the trouble of carving the furniture yourself: five blank Markdown files (`identity.md`, `description.md`, `personality.md`, `physical-description.md`, `example-dialogues.md`), two seeded JSON files (`properties.json` for `pronouns`, `aliases`, `title`, `firstMessage`, and `talkativeness`, and `wardrobe.json` with the canonical slots), and five empty folders (`Prompts`, `Scenarios`, `lore`, `images`, `files`). Existing files are never overwritten, so flipping a populated store to Character simply fills in whatever gaps remain. On each startup, Quilltap also sweeps through every Aurora character that isn't yet linked to a vault, conjures one in the Scriptorium named `<Character Name> Character Vault`, and pours the character's existing identity / description / personality / physical-description / example-dialogues / pronouns / aliases / title / first-message / talkativeness / wardrobe / scenarios / system-prompts into the freshly scaffolded files and folders. The link is recorded on the character (as `characterDocumentMountPointId`) so the sweep never duplicates its work
- **Edit** settings including name, path, mount type, contents classification, include/exclude patterns, and enabled status
- **View** file counts, total size, chunk counts, and scan status at a glance on each store's card
- **Scan** a store to discover new, modified, or deleted files — click the Scan button on any store's card or detail page
- **Convert** a filesystem or Obsidian store *to* database-backed, or **Deconvert** a database-backed store *back* to filesystem — more on this most civilized piece of magic below
- **Delete** a store, which removes all indexed data (the original files on disk are never touched)
- **Inspect** individual files by clicking through to a store's detail page, where you can see each file's type, size, conversion status, embedding chunk count, and last-modified date

You may also manage document stores through the API at `/api/v1/mount-points` if you prefer the programmatic approach.

### Converting Between Backends

Every store card sports a small button for changing its mind about where it keeps its things. Should you decide, mid-career, that your sprawling vault of research notes deserves the encrypted sanctuary of the mount-index database — or, on the contrary, that your database-backed store ought to be let out for a walk on the filesystem — the Scriptorium will oblige without losing so much as a single embedding.

- **Convert** (on filesystem or Obsidian stores) reads every indexed file from disk and tucks its contents inside the encrypted `quilltap-mount-index.db`. Markdown, plain-text, JSON, and JSONL files land in `doc_mount_documents`, while PDFs, Word documents, images, and arbitrary binaries become blobs in the universal blob layer — PDFs and DOCX files gain their extracted-text representation during the move so semantic search keeps working. Your original files are never deleted — they stay on disk as you left them, and you may dispose of them at your leisure afterwards.
- **Deconvert** (on database-backed stores) asks you for a fresh target directory — one that either doesn't exist or is entirely empty — and writes every document and blob out to disk at the same relative paths they occupied inside the database. The store then switches to filesystem-backed and the live watcher begins its polite surveillance of the new home.

In both directions, the existing chunks and their embeddings are **preserved exactly as they are**, so there is no tedious re-embedding to endure, no degradation of the semantic index, and no sudden surge in your embedding-provider bill. Because the underlying `doc_mount_files` rows and their chunk children are kept in place and only the `source` column flips, a store that has been indexed once stays indexed forever — even as its bytes slide back and forth between disk and database.

A small caveat attends the image transcoding pipeline: blobs uploaded as PNG, JPEG, and similar formats are stored as WebP, so a later Deconvert will round-trip those images as `.webp` rather than the format they originally arrived in. This is by design, and the conversion dialog will remind you of it.

### Project Links

A single mount point can be linked to multiple projects, and a project can reference multiple mount points. This many-to-many arrangement means you need only index your research directory once, then make it available to whichever projects require it — like a shared reference shelf in a well-organized office.

### Project File Stores (automatic, per project)

In earlier incarnations of Quilltap, each project kept its attached files as a scattered assortment of loose documents in a folder on disk — a perfectly serviceable arrangement for a shorter correspondence, but hardly fit for a library with pretensions. On first startup after this update, Quilltap quietly promotes every such folder to a proper database-backed document store of its very own, with a name along the lines of *Project Files: Your Project Name*. The files are gathered up and tucked safely inside the encrypted `quilltap-mount-index.db`, the new store is linked to the project that owned them, and the original directory is renamed with a `_doc_store_archive` suffix as a courtesy — proof, should you ever need it, that nothing was lost in the shuffle.

You may dispose of those archived directories at your leisure once you have verified the new stores look correct in the Scriptorium. For the moment, the old file-management pages elsewhere in Quilltap continue to list the legacy entries (a further round of tidying will wire them through to the new stores in a future update), so if you wish to browse, read, or hand files to a character straight away, pop open the Scriptorium and find the *Project Files* store by that name. As with any other database-backed store, the *Scan Now* button will chunk and embed the freshly imported text files so semantic search catches up with the new arrangement.

From this version forward, new writes into a project's file area — story backgrounds minted by The Lantern, character avatars spun up by the wardrobe, and any file a character or a user uploads with a project in context — are deposited **directly** into that project's linked document store rather than onto disk. The old `<filesDir>/{projectId}/` directory is no longer created, nor consulted: every generated image and uploaded blob arrives at the same encrypted table, alongside your notes, as though it had always belonged there. A small internal reference (`mount-blob:{mountPointId}:{blobId}`) keeps the legacy file APIs and preview routes pointing at the correct bytes, so thumbnails, downloads, and in-chat galleries behave exactly as before — only tidier beneath the floorboards. The `project_info` tool, when consulted by a character, now reports the linked store's name and counts in its `get_info` reply, so your collaborators know precisely which shelf their project's files have been placed upon.

## Searching Documents

Document chunks appear as a new source type in the unified search tool. When a character searches using the `search` tool, document results appear alongside memories and conversation history, ranked by semantic relevance. Each result includes the source file name, the mount point it belongs to, and the heading context (if the document used headings), so you always know precisely where a piece of information came from.

To search only documents, specify `sources: ["documents"]` in the search tool call. To search everything (the default), simply omit the sources parameter.
