/**
 * Writer for Pascal the Croupier's custom-tool outcomes.
 *
 * When a custom tool is run — by a character via `run_custom`, or by the
 * operator from the manual popup — Pascal announces the outcome as a synthetic
 * ASSISTANT message tagged `systemSender: 'pascal'` /
 * `systemKind: 'custom-tool-result'`. The `pascalMeta` payload preserves the
 * whole provenance of the deal (definition tier, resolved params, the raw roll
 * and its dice, the transformed value, the outcome that matched) so the table
 * can be audited long after the felt is cleared.
 *
 * **Pascal only ever announces genuine outcomes.** A run that fails — an
 * unknown tool, a rejected parameter, a definition that would not load — is
 * reported by Prospero (`systemKind: 'custom-tool-error'`, see
 * `lib/services/prospero-notifications/writer.ts`), never by Pascal. A Pascal
 * message in the transcript therefore always means the dice truly fell.
 *
 * **The croupier does not narrate.** The body is the tool's own title and the
 * author's own outcome message, and nothing else. Pascal once spoke here — "At
 * Charlie's behest, Pascal spins the wheel: …", with an italic *(rolled 14)*
 * suffix — and both are gone by request. What a roll says is the author's to
 * decide in their `.tool.json`: a table that wants its number shown puts
 * `{{value}}` or `{{dice}}` in the message. Nothing is lost by dropping the
 * suffix — the whole roll record (raw draw, dice faces, transform, which
 * outcome matched) is persisted in `pascalMeta` regardless.
 *
 * Opacity: this is why `opaqueContent === content` here. The dual body exists
 * to keep Staff NAMES out of an opaque character's context, and with the
 * flourishes gone there is no persona left to strip — the same position
 * Suparṇā and Carina are in. Both bodies are still populated, in lockstep, as
 * the `opaqueContent` contract asks (see `lib/schemas/chat.types.ts`).
 *
 * Errors never propagate — a failure to announce is logged and surfaced to the
 * caller as null rather than thrown.
